      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\nHomestuck songs are finally available for download!\n\nYou can buy the songs through Bandcamp. I batted around a lot of ideas for downloading music, and ultimately decided selling them was the best way to go. This way we get to support the artists who did this excellent work, and generously volunteered their time to help me out with the story. As much as I like dispatching free entertainment for everybody, when it comes to stuff that I didn't make, I'd rather give artists the chance to profit from their work than casting it into the wind it for free!\n\nBut the songs are priced pretty reasonably, especially if you get the whole album. More songs will be added to it as the story goes. But really, the Homestuck music is the tip of the iceberg with respect to this larger, somewhat mysterious MSPA music project. There will be some more cool developments in the coming weeks and months, so keep an eye out!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp about blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20090815120135/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-vol-1))\n\n\\> Purchase entire album and see what happens.\n\nYou decide to download the entire album and discover a sweet FREE BONUS TRACK you haven't heard in HOMESTUCK.\n\nToday is truly your lucky day!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20090815120135/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-vol-1))\n\nAlbum tracks by:<br>\n[[artist:curt-blakeslee]]<br>\n[[artist:michael-guy-bowman]]<br>\n[[artist:malcolm-brown]]<br>\n[[artist:buzinkai|George Buzinkai]]<br>\n[[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark Hadley]]<br>\n[[artist:andrew-huo]]<br>\n[[artist:gabriel-nezovic|Gabe Nezovic]]<br>\n[[artist:kevin-regamey]]\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe first official Homestuck album, which includes the music of [[flash-act:a1|Act 1]] though early [[flash-act:a2|Act 2]].

This has undoubtedly been the busiest year (or two) of my life, and I am only now returning to reacquaint myself with what the heck is up.\nMalcolm wrote the chiptune version of Showtime first. I heard it, dug it, and created a piano arrangement just for the hell of it. Like Malcolm has said - earlier on, we didn't necessarily know what we were writing for, so we just wrote whatever spoke to us. I had posted a \"Work in progress\" version to the music boards, and I received some positive feedback. Positive enough for me to elaborate it into a full piece. As luck would have it, Andrew was finishing up the first playable page of Homestuck just as I posted the full version. As such, I was lucky enough to have the honour of first musical appearance in Homestuck, but most of the credit should certainly go to Malcolm - for defining John musically at such an early stage of the game, and for being the sole inspiration behind this track.\nOh, side note: My midi keyboard was misbehaving when I wrote this, so every note of the piece was clicked into a sequencer.

Since it was still early on in the comic, I decided to do it in an 8-bit style, and I figured that I could make remixes of it later if harlequins still turned out to be important in the comic. It turns out I didn't have to very much, since a lot of the other music team ended up remixing it! It still stands as my most favorite 8-bit melodies I've written."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nProbably the first bit of music accepted for HS (The piano version came afterwards but was used in the comic earlier). Difficult to fully recall what was going on with this one, but from what we knew about John at this point (i.e. Bit of a prankster, likes his movies) there was something about the name and the melody that just fit.\nEarly on in HS Music dev, Andrew would basically announce \"Need boss music for upcoming battle: go!\" and we'd all whip up some music and present it. These days that doesn't happen any more (larger team, ludicrous amount of already made-but-not-used music) but back then it was a fresh slate. I personally whipped up 3 30-second 'Looping boss battle music in the style of NES chiptunes' as per the original request. (I think it was Andrew's idea to start things off chiptune style and we've been evolving since)\nThe other 2 unused tracks (Which I still have somewhere) were ok - One was very piratey but quite sinister, the other was incredibly evil sounding, but Showtime had that initial-boss 'fun-ness' to it and apparantly just hit all the right notes.\nThe melody itself is very simple: It's just a square wave doing some broken chords. For the album version we were told to add some bits to the loopable tracks to make 'em 2 minutes long and have a proper ending, so the album features an intro and second part with a little solo."

This was when the music team's main scoop on the kids was that they were going to have theme instruments that somehow function as their weapons or special abilities as well, although I guess this has only mostly come to fruition with Dave's turntables. Well, I'm primarily a violinist, and Rose's instrument was to be violin/strings, so this was right up my alley. I love just randomly improvising on the violin, exploring different poetic areas, if you will, and coming up with things that sounded beautiful to me. At this time in particular, I was doing that a lot. Hadley's Aggrieve was created first in this case, and I had roughly dictated it, so I knew the notes. I fooled around with it a couple of times, playing with a haunting/sad-but-hopeful tone, and the arrangement that you hear was recorded literally the first time it was played - the first time those notes were played in that rhythm, tone and order was the same time it was recorded. That version, cut, is what you hear in the comic. I reverse-engineered the sheet music from my own recording to do a recording for the album. Unfortunately, I was, and I suppose am still today, new to the recording game, and so there are mistakes I cringe at in both the comic and album versions. Gabe Nezovic's mastering helps to cover most of it, but I still feel kind of guilty about it. Oh well."

Since the ending scene for Act 1 was an early pivotal moment in the game, I tried to make something that sounded like Sburban Jungle, but clearly felt like time was ticking away to something big. It's a lot to try and cram into a little over 30 seconds, but I did my best."

Out of all my songs, this one holds a special place for me since it was the first one I did for Homestuck."

Once it was done, I ran it through a filter to make it sound... less good (pitch warping and reducing the bass) and added a loop of some vinyl pops and cracks. For the soundtrack version, I added the needle coming down onto the record at the beginning, and then I thought it would be fun to end it by having the record skip before the needle is pulled off the record. Needless to say, this was fun to make."

I envisioned something calm and peaceful, with a mixture of wonder and mystery. I quickly wrote Skies of Skaia and presented it to Andrew, who was able to go back and put the music in place. Writing this was a real highlight for me, and at the time it felt like my greatest accomplishment."

It came out smoothly, and I do think it's quite the haunting melody. I was unaware that Andrew wanted me to finish the original loop, and someone else remixed a longer ending for it, doing quite a fantastic job.\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n\"Explore\" was one of Buzinkai's distinctive snippets that I arranged - the melodies she writes are always strong, and the only appropriate scale to work on with that kind of material is grand."

The SNES soundfont choice was taken from a kind of natural evolution the music was taking from the earlier Vol 1 8-bi to 16-bit style music.\nNot much to say on this one except it was quite a stereotypical 'Epic' boss battle theme - Choirs, church organs, bells, guitar and fast drums."

So I was like damn that's bananas I'll show him up! (wow look at this nerd thinking he can actually make music)\nI sent it to his email and like a day later he sent one back asking about the music team. FLATTERING, IT WAS.

I'm surprised there aren't a ton of Homestuck fans that are following you just because you made one song for the soundtrack 2 1/2 years ago :P\n\nAh, thanks! Part of it is probably my being not too active in writing music. Another may be that they haven't accepted any song since that one, for Homestuck, but it happens. Thanks for following as well, as it means a lot to me."

      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\n<b>FAKE BANDS (they are not real)</b><br>\nI am here today to blindside you with a completely unanticipated, unforeshadowed album by the Midnight Crew.\n\nOnly two songs in this album have appeared in Homestuck pages: [[flash:1267|Three in the Morning]], and [[flash:833|Nightlife]] (both are extended versions in the album). The rest are new, never before heard, and all of them (including the first two I mentioned) were made specifically for this album.\n\nI had this idea to start making \"fake bands\" based on various characters from MSPA some time ago, back when the music project was starting up and I soon realized I'd have way more music on my hands than I could possibly use in the story. MC was the first such band, which guys in the music community started working on stuff for last summer. The whole thing got sidetracked for a while, but we decided to finish it over the course of the intermission for obvious reasons. It turned into a 19 song monster album, and I think all the songs came out fantastic, and really match the group's motif quite well.\n\nThe idea behind the fake bands was to put a spin on a certain genre, in a way that seemed in keeping with the characters and what sort of music they'd make. In MC's case the genre is something we've been referring to as \"dark jazz\".\n\nI'd like to keep putting out more albums by more bands, with more interesting spins on musical styles to help develop characters and their universe. There certainly seems to be enough talent to keep it coming. I really wouldn't mind flooding you guys with awesome original music, even if I can't manage to work most of it into animated pages. Which obviously I can't. But projects like these albums are the next best thing.\n\nIn addition to some familiar names like Hadley and Bowman, there are a lot of great new artists represented in this album, who haven't yet authored something appearing in HS. But the newer folks made some of my favorite stuff there. I recommend you give the whole thing a thorough listen. Thanks to everyone for working on this, and as always, thanks to [[artist:cindy-dominguez|Cindy]] for configuring all the tedious Bandcamp stuff.\n\nA final note: when I said it was unforshadowed, I guess that [wasn't entirely true](https://homestuck.com/story/353).\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100206233406/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/midnight-crew-drawing-dead-2))\n\n[[artist:clark-powell|Clark \"Plazmataz\" Powell]]<br>\n[[artist:david-ko]]<br>\n[[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark Hadley]]<br>\n[[artist:kevin-regamey]]<br>\n[[artist:toby-fox|Toby \"Radiation\" Fox]]<br>\n[[artist:alex-rosetti|Alexander Rosetti]]<br>\n[[artist:michael-guy-bowman]]<br>\n[[artist:fenris]]<br>\n[[artist:andrew-huo]]<br>\n[[artist:robert-j-lake]]<br>\n[[artist:hilary-troiano|Hilary \"Pie\" Troiano]]<br>\n[[artist:gabriel-nezovic|Gabe Nezovic]]<br>\n[[artist:ian-taylor]]<br>\n[[artist:bill-bolin]]\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe first \"fake band\" album. Composed and performed by the Midnight Crew. Or it would have been if they were real.\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n\nThe Midnight Crew album was the first of our really high-concept releases with the fake bands, especially since we attempted to invent some kind of goth-jazz genre out of thin air, despite the team's minimal understanding of goth music or jazz.",

Like [[Moonshine]] it still has a soft spot in my heart. It’s not as compositionally impressive in my opinion, but it was the first in a long line of quirky tracks I have made for Homestuck. The vibraphone and electric organ were incredibly fun to use, and the whole thing ended up having an Elfman/Kirkhope vibe to it. Now, I don’t have synesthesia, but for some reason whenever I think about this song, I think “green”. Just some useless trivia for you.\n\nLooking back on Drawing Dead as a whole, do I think it was a good album? No, not really. It was good for us at the time, but it was so all over the place, almost completely devoid of mastering, many of the songs used inferior samples, and most of us just weren’t as experienced with composing back then. Mostly it was a case of having no centralized idea of what the style of music should be, and the clashes that followed. I don’t mean that to knock any of us in any way. It was an important step for all of us as musicians and we have been constantly improving since then. I still look back fondly at it, since it was my first ever album release, after all."

They were actually made based on a short fruity loop that The Big Man Andrew did, called haunt.wav or haunt.mp3 or something like that. A jam on his theme, logically, would therefore be called \"hauntjam,\" with the opportunity for naming puns including \"hauntjelly.\" His theme appears mostly unchanged as the bassline for the first part of the pieces. At this point in terms of instrumentation, we were still mostly striving for faithfulness to the canon Midnight Crew \"band,\" as can be seen in [the Extras page](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/extras/ps000018.html) wherein the MC fill 'em with midnight (bottom), so Hauntjam employs trombone, string bass, piano, clarinet, and sax (I forget which because I've lost the file and am not a band person, but I think it was alto). From there on, it was fairly straightforward to write a haunting refrain and then solos for each instrument. I will admit I got a little writerblock'd for the second part, which was sort of a brief modulation to the dominant, so it sounds a little strange. But it still has its own little charm, with the almost annoying trill put in for a spooky ghost-like effect. In Hauntjam, Bowman did some good stuff with bringing out moving parts in the first refrain. In Hauntjelly, [[artist:ian-taylor|Xerxes]] emphasizes the spookiness by changing instruments for more electric organ.\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n\nI also went ahead a dropped some good synths and fairly convincing drum part on Andrew Huo's \"Hauntjam\"."

              "Commentary": "<i>Hilary Troiano:</i>\nSomeone sent me a PM asking for some commentary about my two MSPA songs, so [[media:misc/hilary-troiano-commentary.mp3|here it is]]. ([source](https://jaydeis.tumblr.com/post/19609363685/someone-sent-me-a-pm-asking-for-some-commentary))\n\n<b>Transcript:</b>\n\nSo, someone on the MS Paint Adventures Forums asked me if I would be willing to give some commentary on my songs which have appeared on the Homestuck albums. Well, two of them. For those who don't know me, my name is Hilary Troiano, and I'm the artist behind Ace of Trump on the Midnight Crew album and [[track:homefree|Homefree]] on [[album:homestuck-vol-8|Volume 8]]. I'm entirely self taught, I never really took a music theory class or anything, in fact in high school I was trying to learn how to perform music, you know playing trumpet in orchestra... but I wasn't really all that good at it. I spent more of my days in middle school and high school kinda playing around with the music synthesizing program on my computer and I guess somewhere along the way I figured things out.\n\nIn college I started getting into MS Paint Adventures, I was there for the ending of Problem Sleuth, and when Homestuck rolled around I really liked the inclusion of music, and... went onto the forums and found that they had a thread where people were just posting up songs that they wrote as sort of a fan contribution. I... didn't really have any Homestuck-related ideas yet but I followed the thread anyways and I was really interested in the program they were using, a program called Famitracker which allows you to kind of replicate the sort of chiptunes that you would hear on the NES.\n\nUm, I'm very much influenced by video games in my music, I especially love chiptunes, like the kinds you would find in the NES era or, even on the Genesis or the SNES. Um, before anyone asks, yes I'm a fan of [[artist:nobuo-uematsu|Nobuo Uematsu]], but I think my favorite video game composer would have to be Noriyuki Iwadare. If you don't know him, he's the composer who did music for the Lunar series, the Grandia series, third game in the [[artist:ace-attorney|Ace Attorney]] series, he's one of the artists working on a new game coming out, um, Icarus something or other- oh my boyfriend's gonna hate me for not remembering that [laughter]. Um, I specially recommend the Lunar series, I think Radiation will back me up on this, but anyway anyway. So, I-I-I— one of my other main influences is anime music, like, I think a good example would be Suzumu Hirasawa if you don't know him, he did music for a lot of Satoshi Kon's work, like Paranoia Agent or the movie Paprika. Um, a-and yeah I also listen to American music I just don't take after it as much I think.\n\nUm anyway anyway so. When I started playing around with this Famitracker on the Homestuck forums I posted a few songs and I guess I got the music team's attention. Um, and then when I got to the forums I didn't really know what-what to do like I posted a lot of my old work and it was like 'Wow, this is really old and bad!' and they were already moving away from chiptunes so, I didn't really know what to do until I noticed that, I think it was Hussie who was posting a thread about how he wanted to do like a Midnight Crew album like he wanted to have all these fake bands for Homestuck that would just add to the story so, well, I mean I love jazz music, my sister in particular she, helped me— exposed me to a lot of jazz, like she was part of our high school jazz band and was, at one point the best baritone saxophone jazz player in the... state I think? I don't know, it's a small state. [laughter] I'm from Rhode Island for the people who don't get that! Um, [laughter]. Anwyay, so, the deadline was kinda rapidly approaching but I did wanna get at least one song on there just to show people that you know, I'm part of this team and I'm pretty good when it comes to jazz music, like, I-I-i-it's a genre I love and that I— that I'm really familiar with.\n\nUm, so, let's see, Ace of Trump. I guess the first thing that I thought of when I came up with this was that I wanted something that really did sound like the band was playing it like, I mean a lot of people for that— for that album they just did any sort of jazz thing but... I went back to [[flash:833|the flash where we see the Midnight Crew first playing their jazz instruments]] and, tried to identify what everyone was playing and use that as the basis for the song, like we see Spades Slick on the piano of course, Hearts Boxcars playing the bass, Diamonds Droog on the saxophone and Clubs Deuce on the oboe. I thought this one was a pretty interesting choice because oboes aren't really that common in jazz but, you know, I like it! I-I was actually kinda disappointed in— when I saw that the album art had it changed to what appeared to be a clarinet but, I-I think oboes are better so, you know whatever. Anyway, the whole basis for the song actually is the card game Hearts, um, and that's why in the intro, besides the sort of jazzy drums and the trumpet, the only thing you can hear is the bass which would be Hearts Boxcars's instrument. This is present throughout the song to kind of establish this as his game.\n\nUm, anyways so the whole intro I.. kinda wish I had either made it shorter or a little faster cuz, yeah I wanted it to drag but it really dragged! I think that was probably the worst thing about the song, um [laughter]. But anyway, it set the scene, kinda, kind of a gritty dive I wanna say. And, probably some guys with nothing better to do starting to sit down for a card game. Um, wheeeen, when that whole introduction section finally ends we- things suddenly pick up pace which when I assume that the cards are being dealt and everything's being set up. Um, Hearts Boxcars is actually, even though it's his game he's not, he himself isn't supposed to be a player in this. The ones that I see playing would be Spades Slick, Clubs Deuce, Diamonds Droog and at the time, a femme fatale that wasn't really named because I m-I mean this was before Snowman's introduction and I was like you know, 'There's all this noir and it hasn't even included a femme fatale!' Well screw it, there's gonna be one in this song because I said so! Um, and that's-that's the trumpet actually that's... um... I mean, I-I guess that was probably a biased choice because I myself play the trumpet but I also did it because you know there's a pun! It's the trump! [laughter] Hearts trump all in the game of Hearts.\n\nAnyway anyway anyway, um, so, so we have after the cards all get dealt we have the first solo which is Clubs Deuce, which I thought was really appropriate for the fact that if you've ever played the game of Hearts, the first card that lead like the very first trick is always the two of clubs, so of course the game starts with him. He's-he's... um... okay sorry I just had a brain fart! [laughter] Um, so halfway through that we have the trumpet breaking in which is where the hearts actually break the suit because if you ever played the game of Hearts again, um, you can't play hearts until they're broken, like you have to not have any of the trump suit that led the trick and only have hearts available to play. Um, so halfway through the trumpet comes in and starts messing things up, then play passes to Diamonds Droog on his saxophone solo, um things get— start getting more and more intense just going through the different hands. Um, then it moves to Spades Slick, which is where things start getting kind of interesting, and where this femme fatale theme starts to really come into play. Like, there's a thing in the game of Hearts where the queen of spades is actually the most dangerous card like, in-in fact the ace of spades is the one card you really, REALLY don't want because usually, if you, if you... play it and there's, the person after you has the queen of spades, that this queen will come out and you will get her and as it turns out she's worth 13 points and it's a game where you want as few points as possible, so it's basically like you just got all the hearts in one hand and you just lost the game, no that wasn't a 4chan pun, don't you DARE leave lousy comments about that on my, on wherever I end up posting this.\n\nUm, anyway so, so it's during the Spades run, this whole really complicated piano solo um [laughter] I should address this, I think I remember at some point someone was like 'Wow that piano solo was amazing, you must be an amazing player!' ...I don't play the piano at all it's all synthesized I just tried to make it sound like a real piano was playing [laughter] I don't even know if it's possible to play, if someone can play it, ummm... I'll be impressed! Send me a video of you doing it, I wanna see! But no I don't think it's actually possible and if it is it's certainly not possible by me. Um, anyway but there's this whole messy piano solo that-that leads the way as we hear all of-all of the instruments in the background but, a-as the piano section goes on it slowly very slowly but surely gets completely dominated by the trumpet, um, and, it ends on kind of a sadder note because of that because um... one-one thing about Hearts is that um, if someone— well for the most part what you really want to do is you wanna make sure everybody else gets the hearts and the queen of spades and that you get none of them but, there's something else that you can do where if you get all hearts it's called shooting the moon and everyone else is stuck with all... with getting, um... 26 points instead of you, I think that's how it goes, it's been a while since I've played actually but, um, so slowly this femme fatale just keeps accumulating heart cards and at the end of the game it just ends with her kicking their asses because you know, that's how femme fatales roll they just beat men at the game of Hearts heuheuheuh [laughter] sorry.\n\nYeah, Ace of Trump is just basically one long pun. But, I mean that's-tha-that's kind of how I write my music, I don't... I spend more time trying to think of how to tell it as a story than just be like 'Okay let's add the drums, let's add the melody' like, every song that I write has to have some sort of like... it has to be able to stand on its own, I- and I think I really accomplished that well with Ace of Trump, I think it has one of the most distinctive stories to it than to any than any other song that I've written... um, which- I mean I'd be glad to share my music with you guys but I don't think most of it's very good, uhh there's a reason only two of my songs have appeared on albums. A-and, part of it also is just that uh, I've had a lot of problems with my life lately I've been, graduating college, trying to find work, um... and I-I mean I'd love to get back more into writing music but... I think more and more I'm moving towards my real passion which is you know, programming, developing, developing software and, more than that I'd love to get into video game design and development just, starting to make these games that I'm so obsessed with. Aaanyway [laughter] kind of got off on a tangent there.\n\n<i>(Commentary continues talking about her other track, [[track:homefree]], before returning to this song. You can read the relevant transcription of that segment on that page.)</i>\n\nAnd, I don't know, I-I-I think I'd like to do more in the future, like, for example I-I really wanted to actually do a remix at least of [[track:ace-of-trump|Ace of Trump]] like I believe for one thing that any song can be turned into a swing song, and on the other hand any swing jazz song can be turned into a, non-swing jazz song and, if you took-take the swing out of it, Ace of Trump could actually-can actually sound r-pretty sinister and intense so, I-I kinda wanna do like a battle remix of it you know, call it 'Ace of Swords' or something [laughter] that's a Terra reference for those who don't get it um [laughter] but I don't know, we'll-we'll see. If-if I don't contribute any music to the MS Paint Adventures music team, don't think that that's the last you're ever gonna hear of me 'cuz, I... I don't know, I've got some ideas of my own, I think you'll see me around somewhere."

I so wish we had done more with this concept. Since the very beginning of Homestuck, [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] had this idea that the kids would have fake bands they were into, and we would make MySpace band pages with a few of their songs on them as a fun supplement to the comic, in the same spirit as [dave strider’s blog](https://dstrider.blogspot.com/) or [SBaHJ](https://www.homestuck.com/sweet-bro-and-hella-jeff). (both of which I would link to if tumblr wasn’t bugging out right now and preventing me from doing so)\n\nThe first one was the Midnight Crew, and Andrew made the cover art before anything else happened, if I recall correctly. That project hung around for a while until the Midnight Crew Intermission, when Andrew decided to expand the “fake band” idea and release our MC as a full album on bandcamp, along with the Homestuck Volumes. Incidentally, I believe Squarewave and Sawtooth were originally going to be a fake band as well, and Dave even had a poster of them on his wall. Reeeaaally wish we did that one, but oh well. At least we got [[track:anbroids-v2|Anbroids]].\n\nIn light of the fact that the Midnight Crew were going to have a real album and that I had just rejoined the team, I was eager to contribute to it. The first song I made for it was Moonshine, which strangely enough to some I’m sure, I still consider one of my better Homestuck tunes, if only technically. Yeah, the instruments I used were atrocious, but I think it would be a fun piece if it were actually played by people. I had a good idea of its form and I was really able to get into the style of music I perceived the Midnight Crew would play.\n\nThe instrumentation was based off the instruments each character played, with Slick on piano, Droog on sax, Boxcars on bass, and the last one I changed from Deuce’s oboe to clarinet, which is seen much more in jazz. Not that jazz oboe doesn’t exist! Still, it seems very like CD to play jazz on such an instrument. The song itself is more dissonant than most Homestuck music, having a lot of clashing harmonies and tritones which I love but can understand a lot of Homestuckers probably don’t, at least not in this context. The name “Moonshine” came out of how drunk the music sounds, especially in the middle where it picks up a bit and is more obviously in 6/8. But yeah, it uses its motivic material well and is consistent with itself, much more than I can say about many tracks in [[album:genesis-frog|Genesis Frog]] for instance, which I’ll admit I got much too carried away with.\n\n<i>(Continued in [[track:hollow-suit]])</i>"

I think if I was going to change anything about it though, I'd have tried to get a live saxophone; the synth sounds a bit off. But then, any of the songs off of Drawing Dead would probably sound amazing by a live band."

The goal was to basically make something so dramatically epic and life-changing that it would just be incredibly silly. (I believe Hardlyquin ended audibly on a joke sound, while I wanted Revelawesome to be played as straight as possible).\nAnd it was.\nThe music was based on some earlier work I did on an old Sonic Fangame (Completely forget which one - Think it was a boss theme) that I re-tuned for orchestra and gave it more of a buildup.

I'm pretty Cave Story-influenced, especially with Homestuck stuff."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nJade. I think, at least if not Jade then certainly something about Dreams (Which a lot of the story was turning into via the Prospit/Derse stuff). It was prevalent that a lot of Jade's character was coming from vague aloofness, yet a degree of precognition via dreaming that would prove central to the character and the concept of Sburb.\nThus, it's a playful kind of dream-like melody. A little scatterbrained a quite unusual (Namely due to the time signature which is something like 6/4). I came up with the melody years ago, and it's mostly just playing about on the sharp/flat keys on a keyboard. I generally don't like incorporating it too much because the chord progression sounds a <i>bit</i> too close to Snow Patrol's \"Chasing Cars\" (Which was released way after I originally came up with the melody for BoA, but is infinitely more popular)\nDespite being used in 'The Flash Where Nothing Happens' and also being quite long, it's still one of my closet favourite tracks. So much so I did a remake that never made it to any album because it wasn't really anything new. In any case, it's [[track:joy-and-dreams-eternal|here]].\nI then took an enormous break from HS (shortly after doing a Squiddles track that I don't particularly like) and wouldn't be back 'till around about the time of AlternaBound had started being a discussed thing."

              "Commentary": "<i>Clark Powell:</i>\n\nDoctor was originally by Buzinkai and then a now non-active member Michael Vallejo added a few bits of percussion to it. I then put together a larger mix of the tune with shinier production and a glockenspiel tag, and this was the version Andrew used in the end.\n\n<i>Buzinkai:</i>\n\nDoctor was written before Homestuck, actually. The only thing I can really remember was that Super Smash Bros Brawl came out right before I finished it. The original loop (which is not the one specifically heard in the comic, but was included in the album release) was directly inspired by music from Cave Story, and I was trying to at the time musically embody how I felt at the time, I think. Though it never seems to come out exactly as I plan it, I enjoyed the results. I will say that I cannot truly believe how many people have remixed it.\n\nThe arpeggio part at the end goes between the left, both, and right speakers sequentially. I was too lazy to set the channel settings manually, so I did each note on a different instrument, which is set to each speaker channel. Not many people know that, and I think it actually made it a living hell for remixers who got a hold of the original file.\n\n<i>(On March 17, 2013, [Buzinkai ran an AMA - \"Ask Me Anything\" - on the r/Homestuck subreddit.](https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/1afvkb/hi_im_george_buzinkai_writer_of_the_doctor_and/) Select responses are listed below; you can visit the full AMA on the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20230625011746/https://old.reddit.com/r/homestuck/comments/1afvkb/hi_im_george_buzinkai_writer_of_the_doctor_and/) as well. Banner art below is from a [fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/buzinkai) ran for their first album in 2016.)</i>\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/buzinkai-banner.png\" width=\"720\">\n\n<b>Hi, I'm George Buzinkai, writer of The Doctor and other such songs. AMA?</b>\n\nHowdy. I'm bored as hell, because my house recently burnt down and I lost sort of everything. How are you?\n\n> <i>defenestratedplane:</i> \"AtrusRand\" - Msyt fan? :)\n> I love Doctor, it's one of my favorite songs in Homestuck, and I will never get sick of remixes of it. Do you like the remixes? Will you be doing anymore music for Homestuck?\n> I'm very sorry to hear about your house. I hope you're doing okay.\n\nActually, for a little while, after I submitted it, I was unaware of where Doctor was going to go. It was one of those moments where I went, \"Whoa, someone remixed my song?\" And then things got crazy. I get the feeling when you hear yourself played back on audio sometimes when I hear the remixes.\n\nAnd yes, I am an adamant MSYT fan.\n\n> <i>BufferUnderpants:</i> Could we please be nicer? More empathetic, less snarky? He's a very important contributor to the community and he got dealt a rough deal recently.\n\nIt's a bit easy to say, \"I have nothing.\"\n\nBut my house, which I lived in for 27 years, was burnt to the ground, and I was literally without anything of my past. Keyboards, instruments, all were taken in an inferno which haunts my damned memories night after night.\n\n> <i>BufferUnderpants:</i> That's... horrible. How long ago was this? Did you live with your family there?\n> I've never been very much keen to holding attachment to things, maybe now I have been acquiring the habit, but even so, the shock of everything suddenly turning to smoke must be huge. It must have felt unreal.\n> What have you been doing in the meantime?\n\nI saved my family, and we're currently in a temporary home. I find that I attach to things and people a lot more now. Because I'm so afraid of losing memories, things, and people.\n\nI'm actually trying to draw. I went to college for a little while for Traditional Animation, but the college turned out to be a scam, so I was screwed.\n\n> <i>Stillhopefull:</i> My condolences for your lost everything. Thanks for making music for Homestuck, I appreciate the act of fleshing out a world in music, and I appreciate you for doing this for us. Thank you.\n> As for a question, what's it like working with Andrew Hussie? Is he easy to talk to? Hard to work with? Do your personalities go well together?\n> What's your favorite Homestuck song?\n> Do you have any writing rituals to get you in the mood for writing? Like, do you listen to any special music, or read certain parts of stuff?\n> If you had to choose between dying tomorrow or dying in 1000 years, which would choose and why?\n\nI've never personally spoke to him. Except through E-mail. Other than that, I've never really been too involved with the project. He's enigmatic, but I imagine if we got together, we could do some cool stuff.\n\nMy favorite homestuck song is obviously [[Showtime (Original Mix)]], which inspired me to write a remix and get involved.\n\nI listen to Tchaikovsky and Nobuo Uematsu, I attempt to push emotion through the music to the listener. When I find things which I feel the composer was trying to push into me, I get overwhelmed.\n\nI would say dying in 1000 years. Because my lifetime is nowhere near how long I think it will take me to really understand who I am.\n\n> <i>Crono30067:</i> Did you know things about homestuck before we did?\n\nNothing was ever told to us, except when sometimes Andrew would say, \"Something is coming up.\"\n\n> <i>Niklink:</i> Buzinkai would know the difference from 'The Doctor' and 'Doctor', due to where the title of that song comes from.\n\nI wrote Doctor at an interesting time. One where I wanted to convey my emotions through music. I was inspired by [[track:moonsong]] from Cave Story, and I still use PXTone, which is a music software developed by Pixel.\n\nThe Doctor was my name, a reference to Doctor Who, and The Doctor from cave story.\n\n> <i>(deleted user)</i> I KNEW that song was familiar somehow! Moonsong was probably my favorite tune in that soundtrack :-D It also fits in very well with the Earthbound aesthetic that Homestuck's inspired by.\n\nEarthbound and Cave Story are both my favorite OSTs. As well as a little bit of Nobuo.\n\n> <i>Niklink:</i> Yeah dude's legit. Or a really weird George Buzinkai fan.\n> So, last we heard your life was too busy to really get back into music. Other than [[track:firefly]] on Vol. 9, there isn't really any activity form you. Are you planning to get back into the whole Homestuck music thing? Are you even keeping up with Homestuck?\n\nI do watch here and there. It's quite the thing to really keep track of. I'm trying to do more personal pursuits lately. I'm trying to actually come out with a comic some time in the future.\n\n> <i>StrmSrfr:</i> I was just thinking this morning (before I saw this; weird coincidence) that I'd love to try my hand at doing a remix or derivative composition of \"Doctor\", and maybe put it up for people to critique.\n> How would you feel about me (or anyone else for that matter) doing a thing like that?\n\nI love creativity. If you're inspired. Feel free!\n\n> <i>Newtonyd:</i> How'd your house burn down?\n\nAn electrical short. I discovered it and tried to do what I could in such a situation. I tried to put it out with my coat, then I tried a bucket of water, but it's winter here, so they didn't work.\n\nHonestly, there are tons of things I wish I could do differently.\n\n> <i>CatnipMatespriteship:</i> im broke but what i can do is this... <i>hugs~&lt;3</i>\n\nMeans more than money to me.\n\n> <i>FridgeLogic42:</i> Have you listened to any of the Homestuck albums? What's your favorite?\n\nI've listened to a few, they are quite good, though my favorite is the songs they made for [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead|the midnight crew]]. Very interesting stuff.\n\n> <i>HyperShadic9189:</i> Do you just make the music whenever, and Andrew uses it, or does he tell you to make music fitting for an event?\n\nI generally throw up a few songs when I get the chance to actually write them, which has not exactly been for a little while. Sometimes the music influences the work, perhaps, but the work infuenced the music... it's sort of oddly complicated.\n\n> <i>thetacriterion:</i> Doctor is still my favorite track in all of Homestuck, despite some pretty steep competition. Still gives me chills. (And yeah, I'm referring to [[track:doctor-original-loop|the original]], not the remix.)\n> As for your house... while I'm getting major sympathy pains just thinking about everything you lost, I'm mainly glad to hear that you and your family are safe. I'm hoping for the best for you. :c\n\nThank you for everything. I hope to write more wonders in the future.\n\n> <i>[deleted user]</i> my one question is why \"rabbit-mouse\"\n\nIt's a long story, but generally, I'm trying to get into the field of traditional animation. My two favorite movies are Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Secret of NIMH.\n\n> <i>gburnaman:</i> Im absolutely lousy at AMAs and can never think of any decent questions but I will say: Doctor is one of my favorite motifs... ever. It stands up on its own in a way not a lot of HS other songs do, and I never tire of hearing remixes. I heard Doctor right about the time I decided to stick with Homestuck instead of backing away slowly and calling the police.\n\n> <i>statue_junction:</i> Hey, I don't really have any questions but I just wanted to tell you that Doctor is, without exception, my favorite song in Homestuck. Which is saying quite a lot. It encapsulates the atmosphere of the comic better than anything else, and in my mind represents my favorite character (John). I think I've listened to it more times than anything I have on Spotify or iTunes, 'cause I'll play it on loop as I write or read or fuck around on the internet. It just really puts me in the right kind of mindset to be creative. So... thanks for making such a kick-ass song!\n\nI originally meant the song to encompass my own emotions at the time, according to Andrew Hussie, it \"sat on his desktop for a while\" before he decided where to place it.\nMy music has taken me places I've never thought possible.\n\n> (<i>MrCheeze:</i> It should be mentioned that statue_junction and Niklink are like the two impossible to please guys, praise from both = very good job.)\n\nI want to personally thank everyone who visited my site and donated. I will be sending out personal responses to the donators, letting them know how their money will be used to help get the music production back in full gear.\n\nI can't thank you all enough for this!\n\n<i>emil:</i> ([Tumblr](https://emil.tumblr.com/post/666266192199172096))\n\ni feel like people forget that homestuck had a lot of talented musicians working on it, not just toby\n\nthis bothers me mostly because one of the most iconic songs, Doctor, was composed by a trans person (she/her, her name was [Usagi] Buzinkai, im not sure how she identified beyond her pronouns) who passed away in 2018. for all of homestuck’s many flaws i think it’s okay and good to celebrate art like this that came from it\n\n(edited to include her correct name)\n\n<i>blunttheking:</i> ([Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/blunttheking/666268683781521408/homestuck-doctor-i-know-i-already-reblogged))\n\ni know i already reblogged this but here's Doctor so you can remind yourself what a great song it is\n\n*[Bandcamp embed]*\n\n<i>Clark Powell:</i> ([Tumblr](https://plazmataz.tumblr.com/post/669762656269484032/the-song-doctor-was-a-collaboration-piece-between))\n\nthe song Doctor was a collaboration piece between me and Buzinkai. They made the super lush chiptune that’s the backbone of the song, and I arranged it with other instruments to try and really bring it to life. As one of the first songs either of us finished for the comic in those early days, we were both so proud of it ☺️\n\nRest easy, George. Your music still plays."

([1:29](https://youtu.be/QbsXLDNPvNc?t=89)) It's from a song recorded exactly 100 years prior to Homestuck.

      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\nHomestuck Vol. 5 is here. To call it a mega-album is an understatement. IT HAS 71 SONGS.\n\nAnd before I get carried away talking about it, we're releasing this under a new VERY SERIOUS AND LEGIT RECORD LABEL, which is called What Pumpkin. I thought this would be a much tidier container for all these crazy music projects we're cranking out. Oh and there will be more.\n\nThe idea I had for volume five was to gather up a lot of music that had been accumulating, and stuff it all into this monster album. Like, WAY more songs than would ever be sensible to put in an album and still call it an album. The result is something so audacious, it just might be COMPLETELY MINDBLOWINGLY INCREDIBLE. You be the judge. I already know your verdict though.\n\nAdditionally the concept was to make a huge soundtrack that touches on the magnitude of the story that has been swelling steadily for more than a year. The soundtrack is meant to evoke all the things taking place that we perhaps aren't seeing in this universe, or that could happen, but that the linear focus of the narrative simply can't contain. You're invited to imagine the bigger story the album is telling.\n\nBear in mind this album is not merely a giant song dump. I feel like I arranged this mix pretty carefully. And on top of that, <b>it is a seamless album.</b> There are transitions between songs built into the songs, so it all runs together as a cohesive whole. It's all equalized and mastered very well. <b>There is nearly three solid hours of music to listen to.</b> And it is less than fifteen dollars.\n\nNow it seems like I can never release one of these things without thanking my knuckles to a bloody pulp as I rain blows of merciless gratitude on everyone around me, and for good reason. Lots of people worked their asses off on this thing. It always seems like such a simple idea. Hey lets make an album! All this music is right here it'll take like two seconds to ram it out. Wrong stupid! So here I am assuming the flying crane position of indebtedness while I meditate on the fact that I'm about to snap the spines of fifty helpless thank ninjas in cold blooded succession.\n\nThanks to [[artist:cindy-dominguez|Cindy]] who worked forever on the new website and uploaded a million giant high quality songs which take forever to upload as it turns out and also hounding everyone for their files and stuff. Thanks to [[group:clark-powell|Clark Powell]] for doing great mastering/equalizing work on all the songs, and thanks to [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]] for doing <i>additionally great</i> work of a similar nature. Thanks to all the musicians for lighting a fire under their bone bulges to get high quality files to us and of course not being able to help themselves from making all these killer upgrades to the music itself in the process. And thanks to [[artist:lexxy|Lexxy]] for the ultraslick cover art!\n\nI am never going to stop listening to this thing. Never. They'll have to send the cadaver dogs into my fucking unibomber shack cause I ain't coming out, and the fire ants will be wondering how they're gonna eat the rotting pulp in my skull with these headphones blocking my earholes like that.\n\n<i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nWe're kicking this thing off (\"this thing\" being [whatpumpkin.com](https://whatpumpkin.com)) with the launch of Homestuck Vol. 5, the latest in a wicked-sweet line of albums for MS Paint Adventure's Homestuck. This means you can stop doing the antsy pants album dance; it's finally here! For a while now I've heard some of you dudes saying \"But, but there have only been a few songs in Homestuck so far! There are not nearly enough tunes for another album!\" And you're right. There haven't been that many featured Homestuck songs since the last album. But far be it from us to not do something because we don't have enough of something. We managed [to] scrape together enough stuff to fill in the gaps and produce a complete album, with a tidy 71 total songs.\n\nSo why all the songs you haven't heard in Homestuck? This album is serving a bit of a different purpose than the previous albums. The idea behind Vol. 5 is that you are listening to the soundtrack of the game/story on a much broader scale. You're hearing scores for scenes and situations that are happening in the bigger picture, but that we are just not seeing in the visual depiction of the adventure. This music is meant to be evocative of all the things that are happening in the story while we're not looking. And it's incredible.\n\nBefore I wrap this up, I need to give major kudos to all the musicians involved for pulling out all the stops on this album, to [[artist:clark-powell|Clark \"Plazmataz\" Powell]] and [[artist:toby-fox|Toby \"Radiation\" Fox]] for giving me a huge hand in prepping this monster album, and to [[artist:lexxy|Lexxy Douglass]] for taking on the album cover art on short notice and delivering a beautiful work of art. And also I think I'll sneak in a thanks to [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] for busting his ass all the time to produce the vehicle that supports all this amazing music.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100615225737/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe fifth official Homestuck album, and is just rife with music. Has songs that span Acts 2 to 5, plus brand new tunes.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com \"about the albums\" blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20100616162425/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/albums.html))\n\nThe fifth official Homestuck album, and which is totally insane and exploding with music. Has songs that span Acts 2 to 5, plus about a billion brand new tunes you haven't heard before.\n\n<small>[Gorgeous](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035318/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/images/vol5_front.png) album cover art by [[artist:lexxy|Alexandra \"Lexxy\" Douglass]]</small>\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n\nThis Volume is a little bit of an oddity in that it's hyper-long and is consisted overwhelmingly of tracks that have not appeared in the comic whatsoever, so you might not be quite so initially motivated to purchase it as you would for one of the soundtracks proper, however, I assure you, there is some really great material on there. The album hits the tip of the creative iceberg that has been the MSPA music project (which I guess is now formally What Pumpkin records) and shows only a fraction of the endless piles upon piles of \"other\" music that exists on the not-so-secret music forums.\n\n[[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] has been definitely at a crossroads with the music - the response to his open casting call for the music project over a year ago almost immediately exploded with music, initially with the pretense that we were going to be creating short loops (as in the strife themes such as [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime]]). However, when the comic started to operate more cinematically and less like an adventure game, more and more the concentration became on how our music could be used to create the numerous extensive flash-animated cutscenes, some of which fans have awaited and anticipated for days on end.\n\nThis pretty much imploded with the [[flash:1149|end of Act 3]], when Andrew informed us all that he was going to cut back on the animations after spending a week working on the accompanying animation for [[Sburban Jungle]] day and night on end. Since then, the focus has drifted to various new sectors which I guess will just have to be a surprise to all of you. Either way, consider the new album an outlet for you to sample music inspired by and written for Homestuck and as a chance to support this new community that Andrew has shepherded.\n\n<i>Lexxy:</i> (cover artist & booklet editor, [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/lexxercise/art/Homestuck-Vol-5-167501453))\n\nOn Wednesday this past week, I was offered the task of illustrating the album cover for the Homestuck Vol. 5 Soundtrack, and this is a preview of the result! Since this album is a whopping *71 tracks long,* featuring a wealth of unreleased original songs as well as remixes and the latest [S] tracks, I decided to go the extra mile and produce a small PDF album insert with a full track list of each song title and its artist. The images shown here are the wraparound illustration that makes up the front and back covers and a modified version of the background that was faded to put behind the inner pages.\n\nI might make the plain background into some desktop wallpapers to share, but if you want the nice, big print-quality version of the first one, you'll have to buy the album! It's not expensive, and you'll be supporting the musicians who help make Homestuck such a unique and awesome webcomic!\n\nToday also marks the launch of MSPA's official record label, What Pumpkin?, so check it out!\n\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nTrack art on these tracks has been uploaded from the [Homestuck Vol. 5 Anthology](https://sollay-b.tumblr.com/post/188094230423/hello-a-couple-of-years-ago-allyssinian)! The official release of Vol. 5 didn't come with track art; this collaborative project organized artists to submit their own original art for the album. The art was originally shared in a huge colection on tumblr on 4/13/17 and has now been collected here for viewing convenience and discoverability!\n\n(Check out the [Vol. 5 Anthology Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyxgBfhPEG8) for an awesome animated showing of the anthology art and original tracks!)\n\n<i>allyssinian:</i> (anthology announcement, [Tumblr](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/154730733932/vol5anthology-homestuck-vol-5-track-fan-art), excerpt)\n\nHomestuck Vol. 5 Track Fan Art: Call for Artists!\n\nHi everyone, @allyssinian here! Over the last few months, I came to the realization that out of all the albums for homestuck, Vol. 5 is the only numbered album to not have individual track art, which is a shame because Vol. 5 has some of the best music for the comic!\n\nThat’s where we come in: as a collaboration between [[artist:cityinthesea|@cityinthesea]] and I, we will be hosting a track fan art anthology! There will be one piece of art per track, for all 65 songs (above is an example of [[track:endless-climbing|039- Endless Climbing]], by @allyssinian).\n\nThe final deliverable will be a free downloadable file of all the images. Because of issues with copyright, this is an unpaid fan project, but we hope you enjoy participating all the same!\n\n<i>Vol. 5 Track Art Anthology:</i> ([Tumblr set #2](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159528808107/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #3](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159531042667/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #4](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159533259415/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #5](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159535479078/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #6](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159537863827/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #7](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159540270055/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have), [set #8](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159542834944/hey-everyone-its-413-and-that-means-we-have))\n\nHey everyone!

A couple of years ago, [[artist:allyssinian|@allyssinian]], [[artist:cityinthesea|@cityinthesea]] and I (but first of all ally, lest we forget) gathered a large group of artists to draw the missing art of Volume 5, but the collective download link is no longer up and none of us has access to the official Tumblr account anymore, so I’m making this post now to share a new one!\n\n<big><i>[&gt;&gt; Download Homestuck Vol 5 Anthology](http://www.mediafire.com/file/p60lh3ku3fzvj10/HS_Vol_5_Anthology.zip/file)</i></big>\n\nWe had a fantastic time and the results were absolutely amazing!

But I had nothing but cheap stuff at the time, so I think this one suffers a lot. Personal regret aside, I composed this as an ode to John, so it features the themes from [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] and [[Harlequin]]. I wanted something big and dramatic, so I went the semi-orchestral route, and completely transformed the context of the two melodies I used to suit the mood of the piece. In particular, Harlequin seems almost unrecognizable unless you’re paying attention or have a good ear. I think its attempt to come off as big and noble is a little heavy-handed at times, but it would definitely be a fun one to come back to and update.\n\n<i>Sollay:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/159969890431/sol-lay-my-second-piece-for-the-vol-5-anthology))\n\nMy second piece for the Vol 5 Anthology project!!"

The effect of it reminds [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia]] of arriving in a village in \"final fantasy or chrono cross or something and it's initially all peaceful and then by the end of the game it's totally raped and pillaged.\" So the calm before the storm then?

It came about in a strange, almost fateful way, and I think the final product reflects that. It was the first thing that [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] and I worked on together, and it was through Hardchorale that our friendship started. He approached me with a MIDI file he had made, intending it to be a sort of “boss battle” arrangement of [[Chorale for Jaspers]] in the style of [[Harleboss]]. He asked if I would be interested in producing it, since at the time he was just starting out and had no means to do so. I agreed, Chorale being one of my favorite Homestuck tunes. So I produced it in a DAW to make it sound “good”, and relative to the MIDI file it sounded great, and we were both really happy with it. Radiation got [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|Bowman]] to record some heavy metal meows, which he apparently almost got kicked out of his apartment for recording and claims to have video of, though I have yet to see it. Once I found out it was going to be on Vol. 5, I added a section to it (roughly the last third of the piece) and at the very end sneaked [[track:squiddles|the Squiddles theme]] just because I could. I realize that was more of a narrative than a commentary, but it’s the history behind this piece that I find fun to talk about more than the piece itself.\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nHarchorale was another [[track:chorale-for-jaspers|Chorale]] arrangement by Alexander and Toby for which I contributed more vocals. The morning after I recorded the yelping and yowling for this arrangement, I received an ultimatum from my apartment complex, saying that if they ever received another noise complaint they would evict us so hard we would probably go blind. I know [[artist:richard-gung|Richard]] has footage of me recording this somewhere, so I'll surely post it when I find it."

This is the reason [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] has gone on the record as saying [[track:crystamanthequins|Crystamenthequins]] was intended to accompany Jade’s island being destroyed/her entering her land (I’m pretty sure that’s how he described it) was because of this song. It’s actually a really simple tune, and I’ve wanted to expand on it for ages but never got around to it. The entire piece consists of the same simple chord progression, but it’s a good, if played out, progression. That and the beautiful harmonies one is guaranteed to find with it is why I think this is one of my more popular songs. It’s not as well-composed as I’d like it to be, but it is definitely catchy. And [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] was responsible for the name, jokingly calling it “crystalanthemums” after I described it as sounding like a crystalline flower. I decided that was as good a name as any, and I’ve had the pleasure of infecting its two remixes with such silly-sounding titles.\n\n<i>Chumi:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://chuchumi.tumblr.com/post/159546207889/heres-my-entry-for-the-volume-5-anthology-i-was))\n\nhere’s my entry for the [volume 5 anthology](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/)! i was lucky enough to be able to draw for [crystalanthemums](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8GVlwRrXC8)!

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (composer, original commentary)\n\nMy Skaia remix was actually done before I joined the music team.  I had first made [[track:doctor-deep-breeze-mix|a remix of Doctor]] (which you can hear [here](https://homestuckgaiden.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-deep-breeze-mix)), which apparently really caught the attention of the team, in part thanks to Blueberry.\n\nAnyway, just as I do now, I streamed music pretty regularly back then, and I'd often times do some improvisational piano over the rest of the mix I made for Incipisphere. Of course, one of those improv sessions (though not a live one) is what made it into the final mix.\n\nUltimately, [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] told me it would probably be a good idea to not release Incipisphere Mix anywhere, and then eventually I got a private message from [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] saying he wanted a .wav of it.\n\nAnd the rest, I guess, is history?\n\nOh, and one more thing: AndrewNeo, the guy who runs skaia.net, named both my Doctor remix and my Skaia remix.\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> (composer, commentary redux)\n\nLet's have a bit of history before we jump into things with this song.\n\n<b>A Bit of History</b>\n\nI've been writing music among the longest out of all of the team members (9 and a half years now), but definitely not the longest. However, I definitely have to say I've improved more over the past two years than the seven years before that just from working with so many talented people.\n\nBut the difference in improvement between then and now is a story for another day. Let's zip right just before I joined the team. While Skaia (Incipisphere Mix) is my first official Homestuck song, [[track:doctor-deep-breeze-mix|Doctor (Deep Breeze Mix)]] is my first Homestuck-related song, which you can download [here](https://homestuckgaiden.bandcamp.com/track/doctor-deep-breeze-mix).\n\nThe reason I'm mentioning my Doctor remix is because it very much helped put Incipisphere Mix on Volume 5. From what I was told, it turned a few heads on the team. Kind of hilarious to go back and look at the thread, because multiple of my chums posted just after I did and I wasn't even aware of who they were at the time. Then again, I was still VERY new to the community at the time. My very first post on the MSPA Forums was of a WIP of my Doctor remix.\n\nBlueberry eventually put me in contact with [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]], and I was told not to release my Skaia remix anywhere. That made me very curious! And then not too long after that (a few days, I think), I received a message from [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew Hussie]] himself on the forums saying he wanted the lossless master of Incipisphere.\n\n\"Oh snap! I'm a guest artist on Volume 5!\" ... And the following day I see a new subforum sitting there and I found out I was invited to join the team. Exciting times, indeed.\n\n<b>The Song Itself</b>\n\nNow, I'm sure people are wondering why I went with doing a remix of [[track:skies-of-skaia|Skies of Skaia]]. Well, simply put, I really liked the chord progression, and I really enjoyed one of the remixes that was formerly in the discography. Because of both, I decided I wanted to do something with a bit of a heavier sound to it, but keeping consistent with the light and vibrant tone qualities.\n\nThe bassline and drums definitely helped give the song a much heavier feel than the original, showing an earlier example of what I feel has become my typical contrast in music. I very much enjoy contrasts in all art forms. Unexpected contrasts that are executed well just really made me happy. I can't say I'm particularly happy with the bassline now, but back then that was pretty appropriate for my skill level, plus having an arpeggiating sound that I really used to do too much.\n\nOf course, the comments I see the most on this song are on the improvised piano part. Before I was on the team I started doing a regular broadcast on the skaia.net internet radio, and I'd improvise over this song pretty often back then. I eventually figured out a few parts that I wanted to keep consistent, and I did a bunch of takes to finally get to what you hear in the final song. Of course, MIDI never seems to record very accurately, and I'm not actually the greatest at piano (!!!), so I had to do some fine-tuning on the note timings to make them actually sound precise. But those really fast runs were definitely real, and, no, don't ask me to play it again. I won't be able to. It was a really good day for me."

I wish I could remember if there was some thought process behind it, some sort of inspiration, but I really can't remember any. Most likely, that was for the better.\n\nWhat I mean is, I used to do a lot of improvisation after theater classes, instead of practicing, while my mother would clean up the various classrooms that were used. There was never really any inspiration for things that I can remember, and they were just a lot of off-the-cuff experiments of a sort, I guess. Some probably turned out great, and there were probably more than a couple days where nothing happened. I can remember trying to emulate different video game soundtracks or bits from them, but that was never really a norm. The only thing I'd ever think regularly was how no one would ever actually hear the improvisation I was playing, and I was okay with that. This was before college, anyway.\n\nMy point is, improvisation rarely had a point, so it's really impossible to nail down if there was any reason for playing Sarabande that night. The way it went about, I just played the piece, exactly how it was recorded, aside from one little mistake. Then I stopped, went \"Okay yeah, that was good\", packed up, and left. A while later, I needed to play things for the composer concert, so I performed it from memory, and that's where the recording came from.\n\nIt's kind of gained a status among the fandom for being music for when John reads Jade's letter, which I think is a rather good place for it to go. Although, I think I actually called it \"Rooftop Waltz\" at one point, for Rose/Dave shipping stuff, buuuuut I'm rather glad that the \"purpose\" and title is changed now. \"Rooftop Waltz\", that's such an awful cheesy love title, plus, the piece really is a sarabande. I mean literally, it fits the genre fairly well, plus my composition prof called it \"a perfect sarabande\", so there we go.\n\n<i>Sollay:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/post/160081839912/sol-lay-my-first-piece-for-the-vol-5-anthology))\n\nMy first piece for the Vol 5 Anthology project, plus desktop version :)\n\n<i>Sollay:</i> (alternate artwork)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/sarabande-bonus.jpg\" width=\"375\" warning=\"alcohol\">"

I went for a whimsical, dreamy feel with this one, expressed through the ¾ meter, waltz patterns, Lydian mode, and ringing, bell-like timbres. There’s not a lot going on in this one, though I think it’s charming in a childlike way. It was the first piece I made upon my return to the music team (I was in it since the beginning, but never made anything worthwhile and left for a few months since I was starting my first year of college).\n\n<i>Alex Rosetti:</i> (composer, extra comments in reply to a Tumblr question)\n\nFor some reason waltzes, Lydian mode, harps, and bell-like timbres seemed like the most appropriate ways to evoke dreams for me. I was inspired to make it ever since seeing Jade's dream self, and how appropriate that it was included in [[flash:1720|Dave's dream in Derse]]!\n\nFor those not around since the beginning of that page or who don't know the history, it was originally full of [[artist:bill-bolin|Bill Bolin]] tunes (a former music team member who left on very bad terms) and we had to replace them with existing material. One of the things [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] put in there was Phantasmagoric Waltz, and now that page has the additional comedy of Dave and Rose jamming out to...a sweet, slow-paced romantic dance? I can dig it.\n\nFor the record, that's not a cell phone vibration, whatever you are hearing is there just by chance.\n\n<i>Dzu:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://dzueni.tumblr.com/post/159588803092/20-phantasmagoric-waltz-heres-the-piece-i), excerpt)\n\nHere’s the piece I did for the [Homestuck Volume 5 Fan Anthology](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/)!

It started life as a midi called Battle Chorale (obviously, a pun on \"battle royale\"). It was pretty popular, if I recall correctly, though there wasn't a lot of fan music around in those days to compare to. Some time after joining the team, one of the other musicians created their own hard rock [[track:chorale-for-jaspers|Chorale]] remix by that same name! So I updated my old one under a new name, and [[artist:alex-rosetti|Albatross]] and [[artist:toby-fox|Rad]] created their [[Hardchorale]] remix too.

Fun fact: did you know [[artist:diane-warren|Dianne Warren]] also wrote [[track:i-dont-want-to-miss-a-thing-aerosmith|\"Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\"]] from Armageddon? She has like the best career ever, writing the cheesiest, most epic love songs ever for some of the most ridiculous action movies of all time.\n\nI actually put a lot of work into it, retaking the vocals and guitar parts entirely before extending the song an extra verse. Nick's drunken air guitar solo remains intact, of course."

              "Commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i> (composer)\n\nThis one is really hardly me, honest, it's all Bowman. [[track:ruins|Ruins]] was this piano recording I'd put up back when I still hardly knew how to record anything, and then Bowman just went and added magic to it. And the piano track, that's just another one of those \"improvisations out of nowhere\", no real purpose or theory-thinking beforehand to delegate anything to it. Especially the descending-thirds, no way I could have just thought about that and been like \"Yes that is a good thing to be doing\", it was just spur of the moment thinking.\n\n(Ruins was one of the first things I contributed to the music forum after getting on the team, a small improvisation based around descending seconds which was made back when I still had no idea how to record things properly. Since Earth was kind of a gigantic wasteland planet at that point (and it still is, today), I conceptually tied my recording in with that, and called it Ruins.\n\nOf course, I really doubt that Ruins would have gotten anywhere if it wasn't for Bowman, who pretty much surprised me sometime before Volume 5 with an updated version of my recording, which made the piano sound better and added a lot of other instruments to it, really adding a lot of depth and atmosphere to an otherwise-shoddy recording. And then, when Volume 5 came around, it was released as \"Ruins (With Strings)\", which is what you just heard in the update!\n\nI know I've got a better recording of Ruins kicking around here somewhere, I'll have to see if something can be done with it.)\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nReally it's the \"(With Strings)\" part that is my doing. When [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] was first inducted to the team, he did not have access at the time to a proper recording environment or midi controller that he could apply a high-quality piano sound to, so he had recorded his piano demo for \"Ruins\" on what I'm guessing is an on-board laptop microphone. I thought the composition was really great but knew that it would sound too unpolished to make the cut onto a Homestuck album, so I resolved to write a string accompaniment around his composition.\n\nBy applying an incredibly enormous amount of reverb to the piano part, I hid the low fidelity of the original recording and made it sound as though it was hauntingly played to the listener from the other end of a cave. Given my lack of any truly convincing string samples, I chose instead to use deliberately mechanical strings, gently de-tuning them to sound a bit reminiscent of early string synthesizers, somewhat inspired by [\"Crystal Japan\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AELO0h04P5k), a creepy instrumental by David Bowie.\n\nSome of the other elements of the ambiance (the wind, the really high notes that echo for a long time) I drew from the soundtrack to World of Goo, specifically the track [\"Jelly\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qznYSE7J4ZQ) which I noticed bore a strong resemblance tonally to Jit's composition. To seal the melancholy, I doubled the piano melody on guitar using a very cool, muted sound with a lot of echoes and pitch bends. I signed the tune by adding a cadence from [[track:sburban-jungle|\"Sburban Jungle\"]] at the very end.\n\nReally, the track should probably be listed simply as \"Ruins\" if not for the fact that there is not official piano rendition of the piece. I think it would be really cool to hear such a version of the tune if Jit ever found himself recording material in a studio again (as he did for [[artist:james-dever|James's]] piano suite [[album:sburb|Sburb]]).\n\n<i>ghostpressure:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://ghostpressure.tumblr.com/post/159560433261/my-contribution-for-the-volume-5-anthology-ruins))\n\nmy contribution for the volume 5 anthology, ruins with strings, plus sketches for Drama. this was fun and everyones stuff turned out so great its a really good collection!!\n\n<small>#that i cant @ bc mobile!! #i don't plan shit so this was like.. ok!!</small>\n\n<i>ghostpressure:</i> (art anthology WIPs)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/ruins-with-strings-wip1.png\" width=\"300\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/ruins-with-strings-wip2.png\" width=\"300\">"

Actually, it’s probably the lowest quality thing I have ever released as Homestuck music. It’s just sloppy. But there’s a bit more to it than that, and that lies in its instrumentation. This was the first piece I ever composed where I explored colorful and playful orchestration. The xylophone and pizzicato strings that I was playing around with would become my bread and butter a couple years later. I’m not currently known among the Homestuck musicians as being an orchestral composer, but I’ve reached the point where there’s nothing I like composing more than fully orchestrated pieces. At least as far as soundtrack music goes. And not just fully orchestrated either, there’s a certain sense of color I love exploring and I like making lighter sounds despite using a bigger and more imposing ensemble. I haven’t released anything that showcases that yet, but I definitely will be in the future, so I think that’s something to be excited about.\n\n<i>vorpos:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://vorpos.tumblr.com/post/159546278177/i-finally-get-to-upload-this-now-heres-my-piece))\n\ni finally get to upload this now! here’s my piece for Upholding the Law, which can be found in the @vol5anthology!!\n\nhappy 413, everyone, and make sure to check out the other amazing track art by all the wonderful fantastic artists!!"

It started life as a theme for the Aimless Renegade, inspired by a [[track:desperado|\"Desperado\"]] theme which I believe was written by [[artist:bill-bolin|Bolin]] back when he was still part of the team. I wasn't really running on any particular goal of contributing so much as liking the style and wanting to make something similar. Imagine the piece as it is now played by some sort of mariachi band and you might have the right idea of what it originally sounded like. Naturally, it didn't quite fit. I liked the melody but it just wasn't working for the whole desert hero thing. So I flipped through my library of voices (small though it was back then) and came across the more electronic one that plays the melody now. I re-tooled the accompaniment to fit, and it became a piece that I always considered a theme for Derse. Hence its title.\n\n<i>Koukouvayia:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://koukouvayia.tumblr.com/post/159549489998/happy-413-heres-the-full-version-of-the-thing-i))\n\nHappy 4/13, here’s the full version of the thing I did for the Volume 5 anthology project!

              "Commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i> (composer)\n\nProbably the thing I'm best-known for off of Volume 5, which is slightly ironic given how rushed it was. No kidding, I finished it up the night that [[artist:andrew-hussie|Hussie]] was rounding up tracks to go through, and threw it in as a last-minute thing, \"hey I just finished this can it go in??\" deal. I mean, I'd had inspiration for it earlier, but never got around to making it until it was almost too late!\n\nYeah, this one definitely had inspiration. To answer a quick question you might have though, no, I didn't know about the trolls beforehand, or what Hussie was going to do with the music. I didn't even find out until [[artist:alex-rosetti|Albatross Soup]] told me about it, a few weeks before it happened. Moreso, the inspiration came from a sudden image I had one night during the summer, in which Jade's planet, at that time unknown, was highly unstable, and Noir had purposefully upset the balance in order to try and destroy her planet. So the entire first bit is her trying to save her inhabitants, while Crystalanthemums plays. The reason for having that motif, well, I'd had this very strong feeling that it should be Jade's planet theme. So, it got used.\n\n(The mental images of one of the kid's planets getting broken/torn apart like I'd imagined still give me the shivers. I still love Hussie so much for creating a villain that actually did something upon gaining obscene amounts of power; rather than just retreating and launching some master plan, he actually went around and started doing shit with his powers. Not something you even really see in Hollywood villains nowadays, far as I know. The protagonists and antagonists are always very separated, no interaction between one or the other, nothing like what Noir does. At least, that was my experience at the time.)\n\nAs for the second bit, well, I'd wanted to make an \"industrial, heavy action, stuff going to shit\" remix of Perrybob's [[track:mannequin|Mannequin]] for quite some time, and it seemed to fit to transition over to that. In my head, the action was going to shift from Jade's planet to LOHAC, where unspecific action was going to take place. I really don't think I gave the Mannequin section enough time to develop, or really do much, but time constraints dictated I give the music over to the volume 5 collaborative -right then and there-, so it had to be cut off. Mannequin's really great, though, you should give it [a listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAyPFa3nEK4&feature=youtu.be).\n\nAlso, as a sidenote, my like for Beck is rather shown in this piece, as is evidenced by my direct attempt to semi-recreate main beat in [Replica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwSzYOiCinc) to transition between the two sections. #MUSICSECRETSSSSSSSS"

I like the panning of the drums although the pan on that beepy synth was unnecessary.\n>\n> Overall its a pretty good song but definately not DnB.\n\nI have NO IDEA what to call it. Really.\n\nffs I need my own genres.\n\nAlso, \"that beepy synth\" was actually three seperate synths, one panned left, one right, and one centered. :D\n\n> Nice!!\n>\n> Its not DnB but sounds good like 8bit style good work! I like it!\n\nI never know how to categorize my songs. They're normally very strange and don't fit particularly well into a genre.\n\n> <i>(Box-Killa:)</i> I think I might actually give you a proper review, just to let you know that I am actually not some dumb ass who can just midi rip. But anyway lol...\n>\n> This is definitely not drum and bass, but I can sort of tell you were going for it. Possibly something techno or experimental/misc? I suppose everyone is better at different things. Like for instance, I know you can create some really good melodies and bass lines. You also have some nice structure and arrangement with your songs in general.\n>\n> I suppose on the modern sort of effects/repetitive/all that sort of stuff, isn't where your skills really lye. Not to say you can't create some really awesome sounding synths.\n>\n> For starters this is way to slow for any sort of dnb association, second of all the bass doesn't really sound all that drum and bass like.\n>\n> You should be able to take away all other instruments except for the drums and the bass and it should still sound awesome. Really, the sound of the bass and the high speed flowing drums is what gives a dnb song a dnb feel, in my opinion any who.\n>\n> This has a real nice melody to it and some really nice alternating drum patterns and it is a good song but it isn't that catchy and doesn't excite any strong emotions. Take a Paragonx9 song for instance. It does have some strong drum arrangements and usually a kick ass reese bass, but it also has some kick ass video game type melodies. It has building up and climax's and all that sort of stuff.\n>\n> This song on the other hand, compared with \"she\" for instance, doesn't have much going for it. Maybe you could have at least sped it up for some sort of climax, or taken away the drums for a while, for some sort of breakdown.\n>\n> Well I am no master of dnb but I hope I helped you out :D\n\nlulz, I know you're not just \"some dumbass who can midi rip\", I mean, srsly, the Synthesis remix made me lol harder than most anything ever :D\n\nI've listened to your music (ninja listening ftw!) and you're probably better than I am.\n\nBut yes, I was going for DnB- it's something I've never done before, I kind of did no research at all, it was effectively \"RAWR LET'S DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS\".\n\nSounds like how I write most of my music.\n\nBut yes! You have helped me! For I intend to continue writing... um... whatever this is... and possibly getting closer to actual DnB!\n\nThat kinda seems to be my main problem- I can't do mainstream, no matter how hard I try to. And goddamn, I do try. :p\n\n(Also please note that the description was only a semi-joke. I really have no idea how this got here.)\n\n> Grood\n>\n> I saw the ad on MSPA! The song is awesome and fitting for Homestuck!\n>\n> But couldn't you just have PM'd the guy on the forums rather than spending actual real money for real on an ad? :S\n>\n> Also it isn't really D&B but this is a good thing in my opinion\n\nI'm not going to say anything at the moment, but the ad accomplished exactly what I wanted it to :D\n\n> Nice, Nice...\n>\n> What's up with haxxing your way into MSPA?<br>\n> Really though, it's a good song, and the ad was funny. You should listen to the works of HalcyonFalconX, you know, the one who did the music for Epic Battle Fantasy?\n\nI thought it'd be hilarious.\n\nAnd you know, at one point, HFX and I had a collab kind of going. That thing kind of died abortively, and we should finish that. It'd be epic.\n\n> And now I can see Dave jumping on the rooftops slicing imps...

              "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Huo:</i> (composer)\n\nSkaian Skuffle was made with the intent of turning [[Skies of Skaia]] into a battle theme. The bass progression matches Skies of Skaia's, with more bounce to it, and the melody of Skies of Skaia was quantified/simplified into a repeating motif. It was mostly composed by feel the rest of the way. I actually had writer's block for a while after I reached about 1:02, and it never really got resolved, which is why 1:21 onwards feels kinda awkward and not so great. I kinda wish I could go back and redo it so it sounds better. But what [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] did with it turning it into [[Skaian Skirmish]] worked really well. There was some vague artistic direction from [[artist:andrew-hussie|the Big Man]] that helped with this a little bit. If I remember correctly, it was something along the lines of \"okay, maybe you can bring it down a bit in the middle, then ramp it up for the big finish.\" So I tried to do that using a new bassline, using wandering skips of third and fourth rather than downwise step in an attempt to mirror Skies of Skaia's original melody, as well as scrambling the repeating sixteenth note motif based on the original melody. Like I said, though, I would say it worked out awkwardly rather than well. It does create a certain mood, which, like I said, Radiation capitalized on. Whoops, I just repeated myself, but in more detail the second time. What's that called in literary device terms? Amplification? Yeah, let's go with that.\n\n<i>innocuoussketches:</i> (anthology artist, [Tumblr](https://innocuoussketches.tumblr.com/post/159539323467/heres-my-piece-from-the-vol-5-anthology-fan))\n\nHere’s my piece from the [Vol. 5 Anthology fan project](http://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/) and illustrated art for the track [Skaian Skuffle](https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/skaian-skuffle-2).

Not really any specific inspiration, I just started out with the thought of wanting to make a contrasting piece to [[Black]]. Especially with the opening piano line, but overall, something more pure and light. Of course, by the time I got around to finishing it, [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] had already stolen the title [[track:white|\"White\"]], so I called mine \"Light\" instead.\n\nAbout the middle section, I think that needs a bit of talk about it. I'd just been talking with a friend about Homestuck, telling him about the numerical motif 413, and telling him various examples, and he went and said \"Yeah, that could be a chord progression too\", and I was like \"whooooooooooooooooah\". So I used it as a chord progression. For the first while, though, I had this dual guitar line instead of [[track:showtime-piano-refrain|Showtime]], and it was sorta eeeeenh and I didn't know where to go from there. It sat for a while, then suddenly one day in church I was like \"oh holy shit showtime would work so well in there\". It was like suddenly remembering you left a cake in the oven on 500 degrees for the last two nights, that sort of realization. So it went in, and it worked much better than the stupid two-guitar thing.\n\n413 as a motif, I've used it in various ways. Not saying anything, though, not even sure about spoiling its use in Light. If you ever analyze various bits of music, though, you might notice it popping up, or other little fun bits. That's all I've got to say about that."

Having acquired [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia's]] old, barely used electric guitar and keyboard, this is the first composition I've really gotten to do a lot of recording for instead of just point and click sequencing. When I listen to this song, I imagine this is what Jade hears every time she starts her computer. Which would be a good song to write!\n\n\"Greenhouse\", of course, is the easy winner amongst the tracks I contributed.

The whole thing was written more or less on the fly. The chord pattern is one that I'd liked for several months, possibly even a year or two, without ever having come up with something good enough to write to it. Then, one evening while I was in the shower (all of my best ideas come from the shower) my mind pulled together a half-remembered bassline from an obscure-ish Sonic the Hedgehog game and a brief snippet from an old quiz show called Catchphrase, and strung them into the main harmonies of the piece. From there I just lay an improvised piano melody on top.\n\nWhen I presented it to the music team it was pretty well-received, and with some of their guidance the whole piece ended up pretty polished."

During the Intermission [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] wanted a remix of that [[flash:3079|to use for LOWAS]] and everyone jumped at the chance. This was my contribution. It's a pretty straight transcription to different instruments. Nowadays I find that a little disappointing. I started writing a new version not long ago; maybe one day I'll finish it and post it here."

It started off nice and ambient. Whatever that piano sounding thing was... it was pretty awesome. I wasnt expecting such a beat, even though the genre is techno. With the ambient feel it had at the beginning, it surprised me a bit. I love 3:27 though, that was really awesome. The main melody went very nicely with the rest of the song. I liked how it wavered (maybe need a different word?) at times.\n\nSo, basically, an awesome song. Everything fit very nicely. 10/10 and 5/5!\n\n<i>SolusLunes:</i> (composer, [Newgrounds comment](https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/229170))\n\nThat synth and melody is SBB's awesome brainchild.\n\nI totally love it."

      "Commentary": "<i>Toby Fox:</i> (booklet commentary - front)\n\nHey, just a brief (LOL JK) message from the guy who made this album - Toby \"Radiation\" Fox, if for some reason you haven't seen that name anywhere yet.\n\nFirst. thank you so much for buying this!!! I haven't been composing music for very long but I greatly enjoy doing it, so I composed these tracks as a fun way to make some money for college. I also created this album primarily to challenge my own creative limits; I'm usually known for creating hard-rocking, fast-pumping tunes with very obvious video game overtones. With this album I tried to show that I can manufacture a soundscape beyond that... that sometimes I'm capable of variety! (probably not what you'd normally expect from me! SORRY BROS)\n\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to finish the track for the fourteenth troll, Larry, whose track is comprised entirely of the sounds of horses neighing. It was a new genre Andrew and I invented together, and with it I would have consummated my quest to create every type of music known (and unknown) to man. The fact that I didn't finish that track is my only real regret. It keeps me in tears. But overall, aside from that one little fluke, I'm happy with the amount of stuff I was able to pull off, and the amount of improvement I made because I decided to defy the notions of my original style.\n\nSo how did this all start, anyway?\n\nThe scene: Late May 2010. I was talking to [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew Hussie]] (as we are soul twins) when I asked him if I could do a solo album called \"Alternia.\" Alternia's idea was thusly: The trolls have an entire game that none of us would probably ever see in any detail. Taking free reign over this unscripted world, I would go ahead and make a soundtrack to their game session as a parallel to that of the kids, mocking the tracks found in the early Homestuck albums - [[Harlequin]] would be recalled by a track called [[Crustacean]], [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime]] by [[Showdown]], [[Aggrieve]] by Aggrave, [[Sburban Jungle]] would be [[Skaian Summoning]], and the list went on. When fully-formed this album would form an alternate \"troll version\" of the original Homestuck albums, revealing the similarity in the alternate worlds through song - hence the name \"Alternia.\"\n\nObviously Andrew was fine with this idea. (Unless in fact you are reading this in the alternate universe where the album was canceled and replaced with the other one we were planning. The one filled with horse neighs.) In fact, he only had one thing to say against my original concept.\n\nI said: \"We're not gonna see their game session.\"\n\nHe said: \"Whoops don't be so sure!\"\n\nAnd then on 6/12, the troll game session arc started. WHOOSP AGAIN.\n\nLuckily, I was there the exact moment the arc started, and I rushed to the forums to enter \"Alternia\" in the suggestion box. Hilariously enough, my name was chosen to be the planet's name (Alternia I mean. Although I'm sure Planet Radman McDoucheface was a close second in Andrew's mind). If if hadn't been able to post in the suggestion box when he was choosing the planet's name, and it was named something else, I probably just would have renamed the album \"Hivebent.\" (Or \"Radman McDoucheface's BIG HITS.\")\n\nBy that point I had only completed 4 tracks - Showdown, Crustacean, Skaian Summoning, and [[Theme|\"Theme,\"]] the latter of which I had to scrap because it was too nice-sounding for the trolls, to phrase it terribly. As Hivebent kept updating I realized that I really couldn't do whatever I wanted with the album because we were actually seeing the trolls' world. I decided that I would just scrap the parallelism and make a track for whatever struck my fancy. And boy was my fancy struck. My fancy resonated rapidly and colly, generating sweet, sweet overtones to each of Andrew's inspiring updates until I had accidentally created a track for every single troll and then some. (Maybe if Larry had debuted in the comic I would have finished that track. Blame Andrew.)\n\nNow that I think about it, I guess that by making music for points in Hivebent without any established tracks as themes for the trolls, I imitated the first couple of albums in their sort of brave, musical pioneer sort of feeling more than I might have if I had chosen to parallel them completely and more literally, track by track.\n\nSo that's that story.\n\nAlso I'd like to clarify that this album is supposed to be 12 tracks long, but I can't stop myself from making music when the opportunity arises. So now the album is 12 tracks long, plus a bunch of accidental bonus songs.\n\nNow, as if I haven't gone on long enough, let me toss some rude thank-yous towards some particular people:\n\n- [[artist:cindy-dominguez|Cindy]] for being chill with this whole thing and helping me set it up. Also for being an awesome fan.\n- Andrew for unintentionally inspiring me to make music to go with almost every update he's ever made (and the ones he hasn't).\n- [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti]] (Albatross Soup) for being a cool dude and giving me pointers on some of these tracks.\n- My brother James for listening to my stuff.\n- [[artist:seth-peelle|Seth Peelle]] (Beatfox) for being unreasonably nice and supportive.\n- My radio listeners for being chill, nice dudes and dudettes, especially the radiologists (Blueberry, Shaon, angela, and [[artist:linnet|Linnet]]).\n- AndrewNeo and [[artist:solatrus|Solatrus]] for helping [that radio](http://radio.skaia.net) exist and encouraging it (skaianet, too).\n- The FanGamer / Starmen.net / RadioPSI crowd for putting up with my lazy bullcrap\n- You, by supporting my music with your cash and/or ears (JOIN MY FACEBOOK FAN PAGE).\n- Larry, for being the best troll.\n\n<i>Linnet:</i> (booklet commentary - back)\n\n<i>Raised from infancy by the mysterious but melodious Rhythm Monks, Toby set out at the age of 10 in pursuit of a single goal: to be the master of all the beats. After years of travelling, he has clearly achieved this goal. None dare challenge him to a battle of rap; humiliating defeat would be the only possible outcome. He is the champion. Today, always in search of a challenge, he has moved on to musically depicting cyborg tits.<br><br>He's pretty cool.</i>\n\n<i>-minibiography written by Linnet, and is presumed to be 100% accurate</i>\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\nYes, this is a solo album, meant to put music to the troll universe which has been taking shape recently. I believe you will find this album shall only further crystallize the atmosphere of this arc. It will do this because we say it will.\n\nBut there is some trivia here! Before I started act 5, Toby talked to me about working on an album like this, couched in the assumption that the troll story would never be examined in the detail it is presently, and that this album would only serve as a tonal exploration of a purely hypothetical adventure supplied by the imagination. Turns out he assumed incorrectly! Which only made the project that much more timely and apropos. In fact, the planet Alternia was named after the album, and not the other way around!\n\n<i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nAnd now, presenting...\n\nTHE ONE...\n\nTHE ONLY...\n\n[[artist:toby-fox|Mr. Toby \"Radiation\" Fox]], and his stunning new one-man act, Alternia!\n\nPlease imagine [[Crustacean|\"Crustacean\"]] is playing during the preceding introduction.\n\nOh, you don't know what Crustacean is? Then you'd really better go check out Alternia, the album composed solely with trolls on the brain. Toby's brain, that is. This is the soundtrack of the adventures of Karkat, Terezi, Gamzee and all the rest of the gang!\n\nWhen you buy this album, you not only get the 15 quirky and amazing songs you can preview, but also 3 extra SUPER SECRET tracks, plus a PDF booklet, which is full of commentary by Toby (\"Radiation\" Fox) and scenic Alterniascape art, PLUS a bigger version of the album cover. I can personally attest (with great gusto!) to the awesomeness of the whole package, so check it out!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe most official Hivebent album you may ever get. Maybe. It's got tunes for all our favorite (and most hated) trolls!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com \"about the albums\" blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035128/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/albums.html))\n\nThe first official Hivebent album, by the incorrigible [[artist:toby-fox|Toby \"Radiation\" Fox]].

Therefore it only makes sense to have something similar be the first track of Alternia. It's not the craziest or intensest thing, so I hope people aren't put off by its inclusion at the very beginning. I feel like it fits the start of the album well though - the variety in noise channels and the oddness of the melody and chords give it a bit of a laid-back \"alien\" feeling that I feel encapsulates Hivebent. In short, it's the scenesetter track ([[Sunsetter|Sunsetter???]] NOPE).\n\nIn any case, hopefully [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark J. Hadley]] won't sue me for CREATIVE LICENSE.\n\nOh yeah, Cindy (Betelgeuse) says this track reminds her of an undersea carnival, and that the ending is when all of the underwater elephants are climbing up on top of each other, about to topple down.

It's catchy and brilliantly written.\n\nKarkat's battle theme is almost needlessly complicated with sometimes obnoxious rhythms.\n\nThere's some contrast here. In fact, when I was paralleling the original albums, [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti]] (Albatross Soup) told me that it didn't work as a parallel because it was a little bit too... all-over-the-place. But in the end I feel like this works for Karkat. After all, he's a ride, indifferent guy, and wouldn't settle for any song that he couldn't firmly rage to.\n\nInterestingly, the melody was created by just stringing notes together until they made an interesting rhythmic and melodic arrangement. Then I added harmony and a disturbing amount of manual vibrato. When I was making it I was worried that the melody would sound too forced or forgettable (especially given the way I created it), but in the end it turned out alright.\n\nThis is a good time to note that I use a VST to emulate the sounds of the Nintendo, not Famitracker (which gives real NES sounds). When I tried to change the pulse mid-note on my VST to get some Virt-esque instrumentation, it kept giving me this static clicking sound. BARF! So that's why the instruments stay the same throughout. I aplogize if the homogeneity bothers you but I figured that the melody was badass enough that its unchanging pulse width is irrelevant.\n\nOne last note: At the time of writing this (July 17th) I'm still not credited for this in the comic. Are you reading this, Andrew? Did you forget something????????????\n\n??????????????????????????????????????\n\nno wait let me count these out\n\n????????\n\nok that's better. now I am the biggest jerk.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/showdown.png\" width=\"300\">"

To maximize this trippiness I added a lot of notes panning from ear to ear, covered in gobs of vibrato. I also put tons of vibrato on the drums (!??!) to make them sound ludicrous and actively shifted the pitch of the chimes so it sounds like they're dropping through a wormhole. Then I reversed a glockenspiel and stole some singing from Chrono Trigger. Whew!\n\nSo now when people ask you \"how does this piece even work, man,\" you know the answer. It's right up there.\n\nMIRACLES.\n\nPS - Andrew wanted to put a ton of honking on this track to the point that the actual music was undiscernable. He actually linked me to some free sound websites and told me to register. I guess in that way, this track is off-character for Gamzee. If he wants the honking he's going to have to do it himself and make it a bonus track; I think I'm more content with this track than any of the other oens and I don't think it needs to be ruined by anything except my own voice saying \"MIRACLES...\"\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/miracles.png\" width=\"300\">"

Or red-snouted, whichever. There is a panning shot to the courthouse which looms ominously, covering the horizon.\n\nLater, in the courtroom, Lemonsnout weeps for his innocence as the infernal grandfather clock tick-tocks in the background. It's the kind of ticking that resonates with a man's heartbeat. It resonates.\n\nTick tick.\n\nBut will the jury listen to a man like that? SUSPENSE.\n\nLemonsnout's weeping proves to be fruitless. The trial begins and Terezi refutes his alibi, the evidence on his side falls through, and it looks as if Lemonsnout is deservedly doomed.\n\nHowever, a glimmer of hope appears - but it appears only to be swiftly extinguished by Terezi's quick wit and sharp tongue (he really does taste like lemons).\n\nLemonsnout then goes mad, screaming of his innocence until he is forced to concede. ORDER IN THE COURT. ORDER, the judge yells. LAW. LAW!\n\nFortunately, the judge decides that fate will give Lemonsnout one last chance. Terezi flips the coin, walking slowly towards the now-shaking Lemonsnout. The verdict is observed:\n\nJUSTICE IS BLIND, YOU FOOL!!!\n\n(Lemonsnout screams as he is thrown out the window.)\n\nTHE END\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/the-lemonsnout-turnabout.png\" width=\"300\">"

The main melody is oddly catchy.\n\nI had a lot of trouble making this piece because the synthesizer I use to emulate the instruments that sound like they come from a Sega Genesis can only have a couple instances of itself open at once before Fruity Loops basically buckles at the knees and runs out of processing power. I ultimately had to render each part individually and stitch them altogether in Audacity.\n\nMy inspiration for this track (and I think superior to it even as a theme for Karkat's medium, at least for the first few notes) is [\"Burn in the Dark\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucB7vR5ln1c) from Brandish 3.

I was hoping I could make an alien-sounding song for Karkat's medium using only the hazy skies seen from his window as the inspiration. Unfortunately I only got a few measures done before I ran out of inspiration, and then we saw The Land of Pulse and Haze and I knew this piece was done for. Fortunately I was able to raise what I had written so far from the dead in the form of this track.\n\nSomehow I synthesized that crying sound by accident, but I felt like it was entirely fitting as the mourning of the dead. So I stuck it everywhere.\n\nThis track reminds me of [Illusion of Gaia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_Gaia) and [La-Mulana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La-Mulana) kind of. Two games with a lot of ruins and a bunch of ghosts, dead people, and mysteries. The part at the end in particular reminds me a lot of La Mulana, because that game is prone to very full synth solos with a lot of bending pitch affairs.\n\nToday just found out AA was dead all along... this theme seems a lot more haunting now.\n\nFitting.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/psych0ruins.png\" width=\"300\">"

It's kind of ghostly and alien in its presentation. But it's also kind of flighty and... caring? There's no way for me to pin this song down with words. Words are heavy. This song is pure flight. The two don't mix. Just listen.\n\nThe drums that come in halfway were basically inspired by the [Coffee Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6LZ1GqSrEE) from EarthBound. Really similar stuff there. That song also inspired Gamzee's tune. I guess I just really like it a lot.\n\nWhat I really imagine is GA waking up in the dream world and flying around, observing the blue orb in the sky and admiring the environment around her. Then she goes and finds AT, wakes him up, and he's totally pumped and happy and flies around doing loop-de-loops. And he's really thankful and all, and kind of wimpy living out his fantasies with his friend watching him.\n\nAnd then at the end of the piece they both go back to sleep, so they can wake up.\n\n<br>... and die.\n\n(I imagine that GA would be on the other moon than Tavros actually, but... now that I think about it, wouldn't it be fitting if the two \"teams\" were split up according which moon they were on? So maybe it's not too far-fetched that I'm thinking this.)\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/virgin-orb.png\" width=\"300\">"

And it's creepy. And ominous. So here's your theme, complete with ambient chainsaws and coughing.\n\nI'll be honest - you know all those free industrial soundfonts and creepy (but basically USELESS) presets that come with a bunch of free synths? I had way too many of those. So I decided to just make this.\n\nAlso this song is very similar (which I didn't realize until after I finished) to the [second track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04ykvrr5_zY&t=330s) to the Tamashii no Mon OST, which is one of the greatest OSTs to a hilarious and pretty damn cool gem for that crappy old system they call the PC98. (Brandish 3!!! Although I wasn't that keen on Lotus Land Story to be honest. That extra stage was abhorrent.)\n\nThose chainsaws are from my favorite game, of course. But who didn't expect that?\n\nThis track is kind of hilarious in retrospect, after seeing what Equius has become. He really needs a nice manly abusive wifebeaterly wrestling theme with a lot of highfalutin' harpsichord sensibilities, you know what I mean? I do.

I saw CC smiling in what seemed to be a non-malicious way (even though she was culling things) and I saw CA taking care of garbage on his island. So I made a sort of semi-melancholic happy-go-lucky island tune, because I figure they're sort of mean but genuinely care about the waterworld around them.\n\nPlus I just wanted to make a song like this after hearing some nice movie soundtracks and thinking of Chrono Cross. So I did. I always feel like I'm ripping SOMETHING off when I make songs like these. Trust me when I say it's never conscious. I'm pretty sure you can find every measure individually in other songs somewhere. Oh well. I guess it's how I put them together that counts, right?\n\nI asked Andrew and he said Caligula invented horse hugs. So there.\n\n(I also told my mom that.

      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\n<b>THIS IS INCREDIBLY SILLY</b><br>\nHey guys, guess what the next album is all about! No, your guess is wrong. It is a Squiddles album. Surprise!\n\nHere is an important thing to note before all else. [This album comes with a full-length animation!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD9DO7P2vbU)\n\nA lot of the same people who have contributed to MSPA animations lately worked on that animation. In fact, they did 100% of it! Conceptualized it and storyboarded it and drew all the assets, all under the supervision of a very skilled Flash animator named [[artist:paige-turner|Paige Turner]].\n\nThis album began percolating many months ago, and as with much of what this music fellowship works on, it snowballed in quantity and silliness and awesomeness over an extended period of time. It began with [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti's]] great [[track:squiddles|single track]], a snippet of which found its way into the big [[flash:1940|[S] Descend]] mashup.\n\nThe idea we formed around that song was to make an album that would serve as the soundtrack for a fictional cartoon show for kids, full of ridiculous happy tunes with strong themes of friendship and chock full of squeaky noises and aquatic gurglings. Seems to me like they pulled it off. It's very easy to picture this as a real show now!\n\nMost of what you hear and see is musician/artist-conceptualized. I didn't have much of a hand in it other than the original idea. The guiding principle for working on Squiddles stuff is, any idea someone has for it automatically becomes Squiddles canon. So really anything going on here, candy corn shrimp, skipper Plumbthroat's connivings, underwater unicorns, all that came together through the collaboration of these artists while I sat quietly and boggled vacantly at their shenanigans. These guys are a bunch of nuts. But they are your nuts, and now their work is yours as well.\n\n<i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nAlright, so we did it. We decided to make a soundtrack dedicated solely to a nonexistant cartoon show about little cutesy-pie squid-things. So we told the musicians, \"make this thing.\" Not only did they make it, they made it with 22 songs (and a short bonus track). Most of the song titles have the word \"Squiddle\" in them, and I'm pretty sure about 70% of the lyrics are also comprised of the word as well. It was just about the silliest project idea you could think of, but here's the thing: the musicians did a fan-squiddlin'-tastic job on this music. These are some very genuinely great songs, with the added bonus that they might also make you laugh. Win-win, right? So go give it a listen.\n\nNow I'm going to say a name, and I would like you to join me in giving some major props to this person for going the extra mile (beyond just making some fabulous songs) in getting this album collected, organized, prepped and mixed, as well as keeping the project on track for months (yes, this thing was a long time in the making!). Okay get ready for it here is the name: [[artist:alex-rosetti|ALEXANDER ROSETTI]]. Remember that name, and give him the biggest props you can muster for being an awesome contributor and outstanding fellow.\n\nMake sure you save a few props though, because I am going to be sharing another name with you in a moment.\n\nLet me tell you about an EXTRA SPECIAL THING. This album is not just about music. Nope, we got a bunch of spectacular artists in on the act as well, and thanks to their efforts we're including with the album an animation set to a track called (this may surprise you) \"Squiddles!\". It is adorable and hilarious and you can watch [a short preview of it here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100830140031/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/videos/squiddletrailer.html). The complete animation is included with the purchase of the album as an .SWF file. It was a big collaborative effort, and I'm about to mention that name I warned you about earlier: [[artist:paige-turner|PAIGE TURNER]]. All the artists contributed art of course, but this is the guy who directed and corralled everybody's efforts, did a bunch of awesome art herself (plus a puppet show!!), and put the whole animation together. Fabulous job!\n\nThere were so many people involved in this that I went ahead and made [a separate credits page just for this album](https://web.archive.org/web/20100830161858/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/squiddles.html). Take a look and tell all these people what a great job they did by buying this ridicudorable album.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe soundtrack for a cartoon show about tiny adorable fictional cephalopods. You've been waiting your entire life for this and it's *finally here.*\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com \"about the albums\" blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035128/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/albums.html))\n\nFake band? No, more like a real soundtrack to a fake children's cartoon show about tiny squid-like sea creatures. Fake *show,* that is, not fake children. Actually the children are fake too. It's a fake show for fake kids, but the music is real and very *good.* Get it? Then get it! The album, I mean.

The waltz gets its name from how it gets \"tangled\" in the middle, turning into some kind of march in quintuple time."

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nHaha, oh man.\nMy vocal debut, and what is it? Me mocking the music kids shows. It's an adorable song, though.\nOkay, so this one actually has a bit of history, quite a long time before Homestuck. I've been at this music thing for over 9 years after all.\nOriginally I was interested in writing a sort of uplifting and mellow hip hop song, and the first thing I did was make an organ synth with a swung version of one of the melodies you hear in Squiddles in Paradise. I was actually working with AndrewNeo (him again!) on the song.\nOf course, that never panned out, but when I finally felt like I should contribute to the Squiddles album (I was among the last to actually start something) all those years later, I remembered that melody.\nAnd then Alex told me the whole hip hop feel, even though it was pretty relaxing, just wasn't gonna work. So I reworked it into a pretty cheesy and stereotypical reggae song and just stopped caring altogether about how it sounded. I mean, come on, it's a freaking parody album!\nEventually Alex recorded some Squiddle vocals for it because I thought it'd be hilarious, and he sang (badly out of tune on purpose) the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and promptly wrote a full set of lyrics.\nTLDR, the chorus to Squiddles in Paradise was actually made up by Alex Rosetti basically on accident, and the song was originally some hip hop song I did over half a decade ago.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nWell, what do you know, my vocal debut?\nThis song has a remarkably old history to it, elements of it dating back to 2005, not too long after I started using FL Studio. Originally this was a sort of uplifting hip-hop song that I did in collaboration with AndrewNeo, but the song was never finished. I'd share the song with you, but unfortunately I don't have the plugins I used because back then I didn't care as much about pirating VSTs and the like.\nAnyway, while this song is chronologically my second official Homestuck song, it's also the second song I wrote after joining the team. The first song I wrote after joining will be discussed next time. Hehe.\nNonetheless, do have a little snippet of what I did with that hip-hop song when the Squiddles album was starting up, which is not too different from the original, aside from a more interesting beat and bassline. ([dead link](http://www.solatrus.com/static/music/misc/Squiddlesofsomesort.mp3))\nI sent it over to Alex Rosetti, but we ended up agreeing that going with the hip-hop style. Even though it was a pretty relaxing song, it wasn't going to be a good fit for what Alex had in mind for the album.\nThus, I scrapped it and started to work on other songs before coming back to it almost a month later.\nIt hit me one day that I should try rewriting the song in a really ridiculous, cheesy, and cliche reggae style, and completely not care. So I did.\nI again sent this to Alex and he really liked it, and he quickly recorded some Squiddles very horribly singing what eventually became the chorus. I thought it was brilliant and was immediately inspired to write lyrics for the entire song, which really helped flesh out everything. It also let me use Radiation's hilarious Skipper Plumbthroat voice briefly, though that went uncredited in the song, hah!\nAnd after some work, I arrived to the final song that's on the Squiddles album.\n<b>Other Thoughts</b>\nMichael Bowman once mentioned that Squiddles in Paradise is one of the few songs on the album that really balances the act between a legitimate song and a downright silly song. I was pretty flattered when both said this and when he recommended this song, among others from the album, to a fan.\nI actually have to agree with Bowman after looking back at it almost two years later. Despite how little effort I feel that I put into this song, it was a really fun and silly song to write... about kid-friendly horrorterrors... in paradise."

Admittedly, it's just 12 bars that repeat over and over, each time adding in an additional instrument track. Still, it's one of the most relaxing things I've ever written.\n\n<i>Mark J. Hadley:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFWWC9vmSzQ&lc=Ugy-xyqLnKP3Dh7NgfR4AaABAg))\n\nI don't think I ever mentioned this to anyone before, but this song is based after, of all things, a tune I wrote in the background of one of my custom WarioWare D.I.Y. minigames.  The two bars from 1:21 to 1:25 is almost exactly how it sounded in that game, except more MIDI-like.\n\n(The minigame itself had nothing to do with Homestuck or Squiddles; it was a game where you see a pair of eyes in the darkness, and you had to stop a moving bar in the right spot to turn on a light bulb and reveal a black cat.)"

      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i>\n\nIn the same vein as the [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead|Midnight Crew fake band album]], but where MC was a dark jazz band, the Felt is an orchestral group. The idea I proposed earlier in the year was an orchestral sound with \"temporal effects.\" Notes, melodies, rhythms played backwards, forwards, rewinding and such, as if the music itself was subject to their powers of time distortion. The sound also took on some electronic, sort of ambient qualities as it developed. You could refer to the genre as \"temporelechestral.\" If you wanted to say a mouthful.\n\nNice job to [[group:clark-powell|Clark Powell]] for mastering this whole thing, as well as including a few of her own great songs in the list too. The whole thing strikes me as a very tight bit of production.\n\nSick cover art by hypertalented and prolific HS fan artist, [[artist:molly-gur|SkepticArcher]].\n\n<i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nAnother one that's been a long time coming. This album has been in the works since about the time [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead]] was released. Clearly there are time-related shenanigans afoot!\n\nAs it happens, if you are a fan of time-related shenanigans, surely you will be a fan of this album. It's an orchestral score, done up Felt-style--The Felt imbues this music with effects borne of their time-distortion proclivities. It's ambient, it's intriguing, it's a little dark, and it's a even little funny. It's a gold mine.\n\nBig thanks to [[artist:clark-powell|Clark \"Plazmataz\" Powell]] for polishing up this gem with her mastering skills.\n\nAlso, have you SEEN that cover art? Wicked classy. That's all [[artist:molly-gur|SkepticArcher]] right there.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe Felt classes up the joint a bit with their chrono-tastic orchestral self-titled album. You won't know whether you're coming or going when you're done with it. In a time-travelly kinda way, of course.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com \"about the albums\" blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035128/http://www.whatpumpkin.com/albums.html))\n\nSelf-titled debut album of the criminal, and now musical, archrivals of the Midnight Crew.

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nAh, yes, Swing of the Clock. One of my better songs. Also the first song I wrote after joining the team!\nIf you didn't know, Swing of the Clock was heavily inspired off of both Clark Powell's Three in the Morning and various Philip Glass musical compositions. It was my first attempt at doing something with a lot of orchestral instruments, though definitely far from my best orchestral composition.\nIn retrospect, it's a bit of a boring song with its chord progression, but I'd be damned if I didn't say something about the shift from Philip Glass style clarinets to swung synth rock. I was very proud of that contrast.\nAlso a lesser known fact: It was actually considered for a flash animation, in a similar vein to Alex Rosetti's Squiddles song. But, due to the difficulties in organizing a full song animation, especially one that was twice as long as Squiddles, it was just impossible to do realistically.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nAh, this song. The memories.  Not really any pre-song history so I'll just get right into how it was created and why I took this song in this direction.\nSwing of the Clock, henceforth shortened to SotC (not to be confused with Shadow of the Colossus! It's just a hilarious coincidence) was the first song I started writing after joining the team. Multiple fake band albums were in progress (The Felt and Squiddles), but at the time I had no idea how to even approach Squiddles (see last week's post ([[Squiddles in Paradise]]) for details).\nSo, I decided I'd try to do something orchestral. I went with a few ideas, but for some reason I kept wanting to write a song with a swing feel in it, though that's more Midnight Crew than Felt, yet at the same time I wanted to do something that was clearly Philip Glass influenced. The small scraps I started before finally settling on a starting point (none of them were saved, sorry!) all shared two major common pieces: a ticking clock, and an arpeggio piano inspired off of Clark Powell's Three in the Morning.\nBoth are still in the song, though amusingly many people didn't notice the piano. It's there. In reverse. :D\nWhile I was messing around with the early ideas for SotC, I managed to create a nice sounding bass synth, but I ended up replacing the sound with a couple of clarinets to keep the focus on orchestral instruments instead.\nI knew early on I wanted to write a song with a very slow progression, very gradual and subtle shifts between sections. However, I wasn't entirely sure how to approach it until Beatfox [Seth Peelle] made a suggestion on the forums about mastering and production as a whole. Before this song I tended to have a bad habit of improperly using compressors and limiters, though I definitely knew better than to use FL Studio's stock setting for the Fruity Limiter. (Not saying the Limiter is bad, it's just really horrible in what the default project template gives you.)\nWhile SotC isn't the first song I put a significant amount of effort into controlling the mix, it was the first I really managed to succeed in understanding what I was doing in that area of production.\nI ended up automating everything in the song, and I realized how much easier it was to fulfill my original idea plus improve on my overall production. Sadly, the song was still very much on the loud side compared to the rest of the album, so there were some problems with how it was mastered in the end.\nGoing back on track with the swing feel I originally intended... As you can tell, the song is in a 6/8 time signature. It's one of my favorites. It's not a true swing, but it was close enough to get where I wanted.\nA true swing is lazy 6/8. Sort of.\nAnyway, so while the first third of the song is pretty strictly 6/8, the drum beat comes in that's definitely swing influenced. And during that section, there's the tuba part. Well! That originally was actually a stand up bass part, but there's really no way to mimic a stand up bass with sample libraries, so I experimented with a bunch of sounds until I settled on the tuba.\nIt was passable, but only after I shifted it to actually play slightly early. The attack was so slow.  It was a little frustrating.\nAfter that, as you know, it goes into the heavier synth rock section. Oh, hey, remember that bassline I said I scrapped in favor of the clarinets? There it is. Back in its glory.\nThe fun big moment, and then the song fades away.\nStill one of my best songs in the Homestuck canon. I felt like I had set a new standard far higher than I'd ever be able to reach, but being on the team has pushed me further than I ever expected.\n<b>Now For Some Trivia!</b>\nSwing of the Clock was the second to last of a very long stretch of original songs I did in the key of F minor. It's my favorite key to write music in, but I've barely touched it since Chartreuse Rewind. (Which is next week..! Er.. I guess this week, since I was late on this. Oops.) Why? Well, too much of a good thing is a bad thing.\nSecondly, Lexxy really dug this song and it made me flip the fuck out when I found out she liked it, because she's an amazing person!"

I love the melody of [[Endless Climb]].  I loved the [[track:clockwork-melody|music box]]-[[track:clockwork-contrivance|esque]] [[track:clockwork-sorrow|remixes]] on [[album:homestuck-vol-5|Volume 5]] even more.  Before I got on the team, I had written [[Clockwork Apocalypse]], an orchestrated version of [[Clockwork Melody]].  After realizing Audacity could reverse music, I started experimenting.  Since the Endless Climb melody was so memorable and it had served as good sort of interlude tracks on Volume 5, I decided to try to make something in a similar vein.  Oddly enough, I think the reversed version of the Clockwork Reversal sounds even better than both Clockwork Reversal and Clockwork Apocalypse."

It's not nearly as strong of a song as Swing of the Clock, but it still has its interesting moments.\nOriginally it was a song called Ascension that I was writing outside of Homestuck. Amusingly, it was inspired off of the work from the Felt, but it was a little too electronic to really fit the album's overall atmosphere.\nLong story short, I remixed Ascension into Charteuse Rewind and, out of hilarity, Ascension itself was scrapped. So, the remix of one of my songs survived and the original did not.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nTo start off, I did not expect this song to make it on to The Felt.\nWhy? Well, it's not nearly as good as Swing of the Clock. I didn't think I deserved two songs on the album (versus other pieces that didn't make it), but nonetheless, that's what happened.\nSo, where did this song start? Well, it started as inspiration off of The Felt but also from my interest in drum and bass music. Yeah. This song sounded very different at one point. As in, in my head, as a concept.\nI never actually did make the version I originally set out to create, instead I made something that kind of sounded like the final version, except a bit more focused on the electronic stuff (e.g. the second half of the official release).\nThis song's name came out of a subtitle I was using, because this was the remix, not the original. The original was called Ascension, but it ended up getting scrapped. The other peeps on the team started to reference this song as Chartreuse Rewind alone instead of Ascension (Chartreuse Rewind), and the name stuck.\nWhat else... oh, I really love bass clarinet. Before I met Marcy Nabors [she] told me she really liked to play the bass clarinet part. And she actually has played the part for me. Not like it's difficult.\nAll of my work repeated itself way too friggin' much back then.\nThere are pieces here and there that are in reverse, yet forward in the chord progression (the xylo, for example, though it ends up flipping turnways in wibbly wobbly time near the end).\nIs it a bad song? Oh, no. I've made worse. Far worse. But it isn't particularly an amazing song, to me, anyway. I guess a lot of you liked it, though, and that's all that matters. :D"

Trace and Fin follow past and future trails, so I made the first melody in the first half hollow and somewhat indistinct, since it is a \"future trail\" for the second melody that will come in a few bars later. In the second half I reverse this and have the indistinct melody come afterwards, a \"past trail\" of the melody that just played."

Shortly after the melody plays, it stops and rewinds back to the beginning, adding more instruments and speeding up the song slightly. This repeats until it is barely the same song anymore, fast and furious instead of the simple cello and viola duet that it starts with. After all the parts are in place, the parts start dropping out one by one until it goes back to the simple start. I went with the abrupt sound of a tape recorder instead of something more subtle, because Eggs and Biscuits aren't know for their subtlety."

This was the first piece I submitted for an album once I got on the team.  Basically what happened was: I am visiting somewhere in Chicago with only my phone’s connection to the internet, check the MSPA forums and find a message notification waiting for me.  [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] congratulates me on getting on the team.  After some moments of sputtering disbelief, I read on.  He says if I want to get started on something, the Squiddles was being [[album:squiddles|finished up]] and the Felt was on the table.  So, for the next couple hours I was invigorated, consumed wholly during the car ride and time in the hotel before I finally fell asleep with working on a track for the Felt.  Time Paradox was made.  Originally, I made it imagining the recruitment of the Felt, picturing Doc Scratch warping across time and space, assembling the green goons from who knows where, and then witnessing the construction of the Felt manor.  It’s a fun track, more energetic than a lot of things I had worked on and definitely influenced by Radiation’s style.  The last two sections are still some of my favorite phrases that I’ve written."

Please enjoy this.\n\nAwesome job by the guys as usual. Nice mastering work by [[artist:solatrus|Jeremy]], author of the first and last songs.\n\n<i>Cindy Dominguez:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nAlright, you guys can stop begging for Vol. 6. Or, if you want to engage in a bit of pedantry (and boy do I ever!), Homestuck Vol. 6: Heir Transparent. We did it, it is done. And it is incredible.\n\nHmm. I wonder how many times I can imply that these guys have outdone themselves before people start thinking I am a bit of a liar? Well, I suppose all you have to do is listen to the album and promptly feel silly for ever doubting me.\n\nI tip my hat (and implore you to do the same) to [[artist:solatrus|Jeremy \"Solatrus\" Iamurri]] for doing a standout job at mastering this bad boy.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([whatpumpkin.com side blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110208011641/http://whatpumpkin.com/))\n\nThe sixth official Homestuck album, and the first with a cool subtitle.

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i>\n<i>(original commentary)</i>\nAnyway, man, where to begin on this one? My most famous song, one of the proudest moments of my musical career, etc. etc. I could go on.\nBut I'll start with the roots.\nFrost didn't start off as the theme for the Land of Frost and Frogs. It started off as the theme for the Land of Thought and Flow. As I've mentioned in a previous post on this song, you really need to look at [this image](https://www.homestuck.com/images/storyfiles/hs2/02522.gif) to understand what went through my head.\nRemember that image? Yeah. Okay. Now then, go listen to the first 30 seconds of Frost while staring at that image.\nGot it?\nGood.\nThat's how it started.\nAnd then Andrew asked me to use it in the animation and it got renamed. But, considering half of the song no longer fit the new theme, I rewrote the second half to include a lot more percussive instruments to give that icy feeling.\nFrankly, I'm not sure what's more well known, the really ethereal arpeggio that opens the song, or the industrial drums that drive it.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nI can't really make a post about this song without mentioning the above flash animation and the following image:\n<img src=\"media/misc/02522.gif\" width=\"550\">\nBecause, really, if I didn't, I wouldn't be explaining a significant amount of the story behind this song.\nThis image of Terezi standing in the Land of Thought and Flow is what inspired the opening arpeggio for Frost. The whole Land's environment is fascinating to me, and I simply had to write a theme for that medium world. As I have probably mentioned, my preference in writing music is for settings, which gives me my really ambient sound, contrary to other musicians on the team who prefer to write melodical songs describing emotions and people.\nI ended up realizing an industrial kit would work extremely well for an unusual drum beat, particularly to contrast the incredibly ethereal sound I had already established. Hell, this song is so ambient people have a hard time telling what the melody is... and no, it's not the french horn. :D\nEventually the arping bassline comes in and all is good.\nAnyway, I was really hoping that Terezi's land would be explored more, but that never happened. I ended up getting contacted by Andrew to feature this in the comic, and I was really ecstatic. My music went from a few dozen people listening to it regularly, before I joined the team, to probably a few thousand after Volume 5. And then with this feature, I jumped to having hundreds of thousands of people listening to one of my songs. And it's grown since then.\nThat was a really mind blowing, and really awesome. I've had very few proud moments in my life more worthy than this one.\nAfter the feature, though, I scrambled to improve the song's quality. I changed around a few things in the first half (most notably making the whole mix a bit quieter), and pushed the melody a bit more forward. The second half, I basically swapped out this very strange sounding piano improvisation I did with the percussion (vibes, glockenspiel) instruments and a saw pad for lead. The replacements work incredibly well for trying to give an icy sound, and I'm pleased with how it turned out.\nI don't know if I'll ever go back to doing songs that are this ambient and minimalist, because my composing skills have progressed significantly since then, and I require much more complexity in my work. Also, now that this song is actually over two years old (for me), I've noticed how flawed it is.\nBut nonetheless, this is probably one of my best songs, and it's well loved by the Homestuck fandom. That's good enough for me."

If I keep this thing up, I'll end like Bryan Ferry, slowly mutating from a bizarre parody of a lounge lizard into the real deal. When you guys find me in Vegas playing to some bar full of people scratching their heads or playing at some rich guy's wedding, please dose me with some smelling salts so that I can figure out where I am and what the hell is going on.\n\nAnyway, recording \"I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\" is something that proved especially difficult, as I ended up cobbling the thing together whilst briefly staying at my parents' house (oh, those deadlines!) which wouldn't make things so hard except that they went ahead and painted the place and changed all the floors to wood paneling just before I arrived. What this means is that the rooms I recorded in were live as hell and it took a lot of work to hide the extra noise whilst being unable to pad the freshly-painted walls with anything that could possibly dampen the sound.

Just another cool song from the greater discography dropped into one of these animations. But then years later he [[track:megalovania-undertale|used it again]] in *Undertale,* thus somewhat rebranding the public's association with it. Does that mean it's fair to say it's more of an *Undertale* song than a *Homestuck* song now? This question, of course, is completely ridiculous, since the answer is: it's neither. It still is, always has been, and always will be, a Vriska song."

I wrote this just after Jack Noir retreated from John and the rabbit. I didn't know what he'd be doing at the time, nor what his motivation would be, so I imagined him retreating to some castle and brooding as he contemplated his next move. Later on, Blackest Heart would be applied (rather effectively) to Gamzee instead."

It was also my first remix since I made that Skaia remix.\nHave I mentioned that Alex Rosetti's compositions are pretty incredible? They are. You should go give him some love.\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nWoo, my first official remix since my Skaia remix on Volume 5!\nSo as I've probably mentioned, I'm a huge fan of Alex Rosetti's work, and this song is absolutely no exception. I had been wanting to do something with Crystalanthemums since first listening to it. Coincidentally, it immediately proceeded my Skaia remix.\nAt the time, I really had no idea on who anyone was on the team, so it never really sunk in that I should do that remix until December of 2010.\nObviously at this point I had gained an interest in drum and bass music, which explains the sound, yet I still had a very soft and ethereal sound reminiscent of the original song.\nOf course, I really pushed the energy up, which made it a lot of fun. I jokingly said to Alex after Volume 6 came out that while his song was at the top of the echeladder, my remix was god tier, in part due to Vriska in her God Tier outfit being there. :D\nAnyway, on to the song.\nSo the song opens with a really interesting sounding ostinato, which is actually the same notes that open Crystalanthemums: E, D, B, A, E, D, B, D.\nHowever, I really gated the length of the note to make it become such a short blip that the sound barely registers. On top of that I gave it a delay and combined with the gate it sounds nothing like the original motif.\nAnd then when I open the gate on the note length you hear the ostinato faaaaar better.\nA lot of people missed this, actually. :D\nI have to say I really love the chord progression Alex went with in Crystalanthemums, and it was incredibly fun to make that bassline, which is actually a layered bass, but not a note-for-note bass. This is actually a pretty common thing to do, with the lower bass just playing simple sustained notes, and the higher bass is more animated.\nThough I've definitely grown to prefer warm sawtooth basslines, this bass has a really nice quality that's almost a square. The filter based attack is pretty sweet sounding, too.\nI really was happy with how the drum beats layered in at 2:16, though honestly, I was really out of practice of doing any sort of breakbeat stuff.\nFun fact, this was the first song I used Gross Beat on. What's Gross Beat? It's something a Time Lord of Gallifrey would approve of in music. :D If you listen to the stutter effects heard in the song, mostly in the latter half, that's where I start using Gross Beat to do some crazy time shifting stuff.\nMan, I really love what I did on this song.\n...I need to do another Homestuck remix, don't I?"

We talked about it and thought it would be cool to make a bunch of battle music for hypothetical STRIFE pages. I think two words that adequately describe how it came out are holy shit. His rock sound is sick, incredibly polished and well produced. You'll hear more from him for sure. (And in fact, you just did! He made the [[track:trollian-standoff|Mexican Standoff tune]] in the [[flash:3520|new Flash page]].)\n\nSpeaking of sick, check the cover art by Tauhid. The dude can draw. If I ever stopped doing Homestuck, the whole enterprise could be kept aloft by the prepsterous amount of talent which appears to orbit me.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp download blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110219143705/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/strife))\n\nAlbum download also includes a hidden bonus track, plus PDF-format guitar and bass tabs for [[Heir Conditioning]]!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110219143705/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/strife))\n\nMusic by [[artist:tensei|Joren \"Tensei\" de Bruin]]\n\nIncludes remixed portions of original songs by [[artist:toby-fox|Toby \"Radiation\"]] Fox and [[artist:curt-blakeslee]]\n\nCover art by [[artist:tauhid-bondia]]\n\n<i>Tensei:</i> ([2019 rerelease blurb](https://tenseimusic.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-strife))\n\nHi this is just a reupload/mirror of the original release, nothing new",

              "Commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nWith the Strife album, I deliberately left a lot of the background to the songs very ambiguous. There are no direct, obvious references as to what song corresponds to which character, though there are quite a few indications: each song uses an instrument that is typically associated with one of the kids in a pretty prominent way: whether it's the piano lead in Heir Conditioning, the solo violin in Dance of Thorns, the bass and flute (shakuhachi, actually) in Atomic Bonsai, and of course the sampled beats and scratches in Time on my Side. I suppose the titles count as somewhat vague references to the characters as well.\nWith that said, I'm still not going to explicitly say \"This song is actually a strife theme for Dave\" or something like that. If Andrew chooses to interpret it as a good backdrop for a fight between Dirk and Jake, I am totally fine with that. Hell, I can totally see it working (And in fact it DID work, since the flash turned out pretty damn awesome)\nI always felt like this song was a bit of the odd man out on the album. While I definitely think Dance of Thorns and Atomic Bonsai were awesome in their own right, they also feel a lot more 'conventional' compared to this song.\nIn a lot of ways, this song is actually very minimalistic. The droning bassline and guitar chugs stay on the same chord for almost a full minute while the buildup is mostly done through sound effects and overlayed orchestral sounds.\nIMO, this results in giving the :53 point, where the chords finally start switching up, a much bigger impact (though the full Beatdown motif coming in probably helps too).\nSomething similar happens at 2:04 where after 30 seconds of the Black motif remaining on the same chord again, you get another switch, and everything just sounds huuuuuuge.\nAppropriately to the title, this song has a lot of weird time-shit going on. Disc scratching in and of itself can actually be treated as a nice metaphor for time manipulation (the comic itself definitely makes grateful use of it), so it's no wonder that it's almost omnipresent here.\nBy far the neatest thing, in my opinion, is 2:35 though. The effect you hear there is actually the ENTIRE SONG up until that point, played in reverse, and sped up so it fits in a couple of seconds. The idea is literally that it 'scratches' and resets the song, much in the same way as happens to the entire universe in the comic, so it can lay down a wicked wah-guitar solo over the 'scratched' version of the song.\nSo yes, this song travels back in time in order to make itself awesomer.\nJoking aside, this song, like most other ones I make, does also have some sneaky hidden references.\nThe guitar riff at 3:18, for example, is cribbed pretty much note for note from the Metallica song Master of Puppets (maybe this is a Dirk song after all?). The background strings at :37 have a very similar ascending chromatic pattern the intro to the James Bond theme. The high staccato strings at 1:50 are supposed to be reminiscent of the theme from Psycho, or really every slasher flick ever. (Black is associated with Jack Noir, Jack Noir likes to show people his stabs, etc.)\nThe original inspiration for this song probably comes from the least likely source imaginable. It's not The Prodigy or Goldeneye 64 music, but actually the original score to the movie Space Jam. You probably don't even know or remember it, but a lot of the songs have a very distinct looped hiphop beat, guitars, and orchestral stabs all over the place, much like a large portion of this song.\nSeriously, listen to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBenCP-51Qw) from about 0:50 onward and you should hear the resemblance.\nThat aside, obviously stuff from The Prodigy's Fat of the Land album bears some resemblance as well, especially with the cheesy bassline. I know that a few Prodigy songs have been used in the otherwise kinda shitty Charlie's Angels movies whenever shit was about to go down, and that's really the kind of vibe I was going for as well."

      "Commentary": "<i>Toby Fox:</i>\n\nBad news for everyone.\n\nThis album is not here to explode your pants off. This album is not one that is going to give you a hemmorage from headbanging too much. If you want hard-rocking, excellently mastered, brainkilling tracks, look no further than Tensei's [[album:strife|STRIFE!]] album. It should wet your whistle for heavy metal, and possibly any other multitude of wind instruments you present to its sweaty, testosterone-laden spray.\n\nInstead.\n\nThis album is for a special group of people. The people that open the AlterniaBound flashes in one tab and then leave them on repeat, just so they can listen to Horschestra 4000 times. These are the people that complained incessantly when Eridan's theme wasn't on an album, even though it hadn't even existed in the comic yet. Some of these people have named their children after MSPA characters.\n\nYou terrible, wonderful people. This album is your fault.\n\nNow go forth and enjoy: Not in MP3, but in WAV; not in OGG, but in FLAC. The nostalgia-rich AlterniaBound tracks you all sought so dearly have been padded out by new experiences, forged from feverish hearths by several of our greatest musical madmen in order to breathe new life into a setlist you saw long coming. The bonus tracks have been tweaked, the equalizers have been set, and the fans, the fans are stoked like the blazes these beats were born hence. Hopefully you will find the tracks carved out from these sick fires to be... sufficiently ill.\n\nNow! Let it begin, young ones. Just keep in mind:\n\nOnce you pop, the games don't stop.\n\nOh, and the games.\n\nWILL THEY EVER?\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110405170042/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/))\n\n<b>Alterniabound</b>\n\nAs promised, another album this month.\n\nI think I'll let the music speak for itself!

              "Commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\n(Aradia's Homecoming)\n\nWhen I made this track, I kinda felt like Aradia needed a new, very upbeat theme song for her god-tier dreamself to contrast her previous emotionless ghostly/robotic self. This song is also supposed to kinda chronicle her change from robot to god tier, which is reflected in the Vocaloid voice becoming gradually less robotic, and the introduction of more and more acoustic instruments as the song goes on, while the synthesizers take a backseat.\n\nRadiation noted that the start of the song somewhat resembles the song [\"Fly Away Now\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZRzVIhBBQg) from the anime Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt, which, for once, wasn't intentional, but is still quite appropriate, as both songs describe a transformation sequence.\n\nStylistically this song is really all over the place; I drew inspiration from Eurobeat, Dance, Shibuya-kei, Disco, Acid Jazz and even chiptunes, but I tried to all mold it into a distinct personal style of electronic music, rather than basing it on a single artist or song.\n\nThe voice sample is from the Dr. Who episode \"Blink\".\n\nCoincidentally, the album version of this song is actually a version that was remastered at a lower volume level to fit in better with the album. The original versions (i.e. the versions that I mastered myself) of \"Arisen Anew\" and \"She's a Sp8der\" will be available for free in 192 kbps mp3 format on my tindeck account.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nSo why start with this track? [[album:strife|Tensei's album]] was last, so starting with another solid track by him starts us off with a good impression and holds the listener up from where they were. It's almost like an unofficial continuation of his album's narrative this way... sorta like musical fanfiction, I guess.\n\nThat, and the whole song kinda reminds me of an anime opening where Aradia undergoes a 3 minute transformation into a maid costume. Please imagine this.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/arisen-anew.png\" width=\"300\">"

Initially this song was simply so, but after I learned more about the scope and depth of the AlterniaBound project... I decided that more of a change was in order for the track. (It was at that point that I also decided it would be cool to have some hidden tracks... leading to the early premiere of many tracks that would eventually be on [[album:homestuck-vol-6|Volume 6]].)\n\nA little while ago, I finished the \"final version\" of this track. It's not incredibly melodic or wrenchingly dire like my usual fare, but it still remains one of my own personal favorites:\n\n- It's pompous, alien, and goofy - in short, pretty accurate of Karkat and Alternia as a whole\n- It subtly implies that tuba is Karkat's instrument of choice, which we all know is entirely true\n- WHO THE FUCK LET THE ELEPHANTS IN HERE ARRRGH FUCKING GAMZEE\n\nI hope you like it too. And if you don't, I hope it pisses you off as much as it annoys Karkat to have this song play wherever he goes.

And then, Mellotron samples happened, and here we are. Also, it should be pointed out that in [[Trollcops (Radio Play)|the version with vocals]], there's a name drop of [[track:under-the-hat-lofam|the fan music piece]] that this is based off of.

It's a delightful bit of dark humour sandwiched between lots of murder and grimdark.\n\nIt's a combination of her theme (Elements of [[track:the-lemonsnout-turnabout|'The Lemonsnout Turnabout']]) blended into a track inspired by various pieces from the Pheonix Wright/Gyakuten Saiban games and a bit of those modern, dancey crime drama series' theme tunes (NCIS springs to mind). [[Sburban Countdown]] also makes an appearance because it's awesome and fits really well.\n\nI've also tried to sync in bits of the story as it happens, so you'll hear a bit of Gamzee honking in the distanec, andthe whole thing builds up to that special climax.\n\n<code style=\"color: #008b8b\">HOP3 YOU L1K3 1T, 1T W4S 4 PL34SUR3 TO M4K3!</code>\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nPeople kept asking me for a Phoenix Wright remix of [[The Lemonsnout Turnabout|Lemonsnout Turnabout]], so Malcolm creating this was essentially a miracle, especially considering he hadn't been around [[Squiddidle!|since Squiddles]].\n\nThank you Malcolm.

It didn't feel right to repeat a single part of it indefinitely, so I instead took several motifs from it and re-implemented them into a new track. It has a similar chord progression, and in ways of instrumentation it has the harpsichord as the main instrument, oboe, deep piano, triangle, and the \"tick tock tick tock\" woodblocks that are the eternal harbringer of her courtroom judgment.\n\nAfter I first completed the song, I noticed that the track was kind of short. That's when I came up with the idea for the second part of the piece - a reprise of [[Theme|\"Theme\"]] from the Alternia album. This shows that Terezi has another side to her beyond her devious Alternian judgment: She truly cares about her friends, so much that she has a certain level of tender emotion that almost puts Karkat to shame. I'm not sure if the bifurcation of the piece worked really well as a faux videogame track, but I think it fits her personality.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/terezis-theme.png\" width=\"300\">"

Originally, I tried a mix of various brass instruments, percussion, string orchestra, koto, and an electric bass. It didn't feel right. So I pushed that piece aside altogether and restarted with an instrumentation more reminiscent of that used in [[Cuddlefish|\"Cuddlefish,\"]] the troll theme I made for Feferi right before I joined the music team. The intro piano was meant to feel spacey, reminiscent of [[Eldritch|\"Eldritch\"]] and [[English|\"English,\"]] sort of bringing the listener into the afterlife. When the flute enters, I feel that this was as Feferi communicated with the Elder Gods of setting up her dream bubble. The orchestral crescendo brings us to the area deep in space where the bubbles float. From then on, we travel past several bubbles, just absorbing the scenery. The rest of the piece contains glimpses of other events within the bubbles, such as Feferi and Jade's dream chats and the shocking developments concerning the troll session's guardian code. And, of course, a major key ending for all the happy folks floating around in the afterlife.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nThomas is continually on point with his orchestral stuff. He actually made a bunch of awesome troll-related tracks that are on his tindeck.\n\nGo check out the track [[Cuddlefish|\"Cuddlefish\"]] - he actually uses a minor version of the melody from that at 2:50.

I cobbled together a collection of unrelated soundsets and generated a jazzy, laid-back version - which, despite its tempo, still sounds kind of jarring and discontent due to the clashing of textures between instruments.\n\nThe tune's upbeat enough that you can't stand up to it. It will kick you down. It's pretty strong for how dinky and messy it is! It's also the kind of piece that could be kind of pretty if its voice wasn't cracking every three seconds. Chances are you'll either enjoy or find aspects of it extremely annoying... but that's kinda the way she is.\n\nLike [[Terezi's Theme|Terezi's theme]], the piece's second part contains another reprise of [[Theme|\"Theme\"]] in the piano - but to contrast the other Scourge sister, Vriska's version of \"Theme\" is hopeless and dark. Where Terezi showed hope and emotion, Vriska only shows fear, anger, and loathing due to the repression of her own emotions, her upbringing, and her rotten attitude. In the flash, the high and low of the theme repeat indefinitely... on the album, the piece ends, but on an unresolved chord.\n\nWho knows what's up next for her?\n\n... oh, and if you're looking for the full verison of Spider's Claw, wait until Volume 8, ok????????\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/vriskas-theme.png\" width=\"300\">"

Oddly enough, this song was actually entirely done BEFORE the troll ancestors were ever introduced (hence the rather inexplicable [[Crustacean]]-remix at the very end), as it was inspired by a piece of fanart that portrayed various trolls as pirates.\n\nWhen writing this song, I kinda envisioned a big ship to ship battle between Vriska and Eridan, with a bumbling Karkat acting as comic relief at the very end. It's actually quite remarkable how well the song translates to a Mindfang/Dualscar theme song, even though it wasn't really intended as such when I wrote it.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nI love this track.

I do a lot of really short tunes for Homestuck that are often more silly than epic-sounding. And this is another one! More specifically, this is a remix of Radiation's [[dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS,|\"dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS\"]] in the style of a Pokem-- er, Fiduspawn battle.\n\nAs a handful of you on the forums may know, I've always been a bit of a Pokemon fan. Other songs included in Alternia have focused more on SGRUB or Flarping, but I've wanted to do a Fiduspawn song for a while now. This song kind of acts as an homage to both Tavros and the old Pokemon games. I tried to invoke the style of the battles in the classic Game Bro Boy versions when creating this song.\n\nListen closely and you can hear snippets of other Homestuck pieces! I absolutely love doing this. (Most of my other songs feature the opening notes of [[Vagabounce]] somewhere. [[artist:david-ko|Ooh, go find them!]] It's like a treasure hunt!)\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\n\nThis track was awesome to work on.

There are heavily vibrato'd strings... wavering, luscious 7th chords... melodic piano... lots of arpeggios... and a general uplifting feeling of satisfying, calm emotion. She is one of the very few characters in Hivebent that I would categorize as \"sane\" by human standards, and thus actually one of my favorite trolls. And despite the semi-low quality of the instrumentation, this is one of my favorite tracks by myself.\n\nIt's all kind of ghostly and heartfelt, like a sad look out the window with a romance novel in your lap, and then a knowing, welcoming smile.

Somehow a bit of Infected Mushrooms influence got mixed into it as it became more synthesized and trancey.\n\nThe chiptune segment at the end is basically a nod straight to the original Castlevania games; I wanted to make the Castlevania influence obvious.\n\nAll the song titles from the SotN soundtrack have appropriately gloomy and foreboding names like [\"Moonlight Nocturne\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-pi8c6Ese8), [\"Requiuem for the Gods\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIlXbaYudXY), [\"Land of Benediction\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ao7ATGYquBU) and [\"Death Ballad\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I9je7sc-wI). Kanaya is basically the Alternian equivalent of a goth, and I've always found it hilarious how goths and vampire-fans on her world are all about sunshine and rainbows, so I thought it would be funny to incorporate that weird dichotomy into the title.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nI like the idea of having two diametrically opposed Kanaya tracks one right after the other.

MANY months later I discovered the Ultimate Megadrive soundfont by The_Eighth_Bit and I decided to remake it as a boss theme for Eridan. Basically everything about the song changed - the only thing that remains is the main melody and chords.\n\nIt's not a really overwhelming track because Eridan is a bit of a joke, but I'm pretty happy with it. The bassline and solo section are some of the sassiest I've ever written, the melody is still really catchy, and the action is persistent. Just listen to that thing a couple times and I'll be damned if it doesn't get stuck in your head.\n\n*I have since done something better called [[Earthsea Borealis|\"Earthsea Borealis.\"]] Maybe you will hear it someday.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/nautical-nightmare.png\" width=\"300\">"

Here we get the best of both worlds - the catchy theme without the weird instrumentation! (And if you liked the original better... well... great! Because it still exists.)\n\nI decided to hit on some of the more Latin aspects of her theme without a self-imposed limitation on what instruments I could choose. So I threw in some vibraslaps, some bongos, and a steel drum. To extend it for the album, I just decided to add EarthBound instruments and beatbox to the second part of the original song.

Hadley:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\n(Gamzee the Killer)\n\nWhen trying to come up with something for the flipped-out Gamzee, I decided to stick with the basics and write a short calliope melody in a minor key. As it loops, however, a dark dronining backdrop becomes gradually more apparent, a darkness beneath the playfulness implied by the first part. The calliope fades out until only the droning sound remains, showing in essence that playtime is over. Also, I figured nothing makes carnival music sound more twisted than for the tempo/pitch to change, so I had the whole thing start gradually slowing down over time, giving it an even more unnatural feel. I wanted one last build-up near the end to build tension, and as it fades out and the listener is just starting to relax... HONK. honk.\n\nOn a side note, I think I enjoy writing creepy music more than any other kind of music.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nSoundtrack-wise...

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\n(Final Battle Against the Black King)\n\nOr \"King of the Twelve Angels\" in Google Translator Latin.\n\nThis was designed as music for the EPIC yet only hinted at battle between the Black King and the Trolls at the end of their game. Rather than making it a fast-paced action-centric doom-fest, it ended up more like some kind of apocalyptic dance number: The Trolls, despite going against fairly tough odds, all banded together under Karkat's leadership into a well oiled, tactical nuclear force that managed to overcome the Black King and beat the game.\n\nIt is, along with the unique 'Black King's theme, more or less a combination of various Troll themes arranged in order of attack. It's probably easier to just explain what's going on where:\n\n0:00 - We start with the Black King's introduction, Aradiabots from doomed timelines teleporting in and assembling, the reckoning beginning, the Vast Glub being suppressed.\n\n1:34 - At this point, the fearless leader leaps into action as the first to attack ([[Crustacean]]). I like to think this move shreds any sense of doubt they had in Karkat as leader at this point. Karkat's theme's quite fun to work with, so I enjoyed this bit.\n\n2:03 - Terezi made sense as a logical follow to Karkat ([[The Lemonsnout Turnabout]]). It starts of quite simple yet more organised than Karkat's section, representing Terezi's initial appearance as a fairly harmless, blind Troll girl, before building up to her surprise attack. I'd already mucked about with Terezi's theme [[track:bl1nd-just1c3-1nv3st1g4t1on|in my other track]], but this one I think is a bit more faithful to the original.\n\n2:34 - The King responds.\n\n2:56 - Tavros in his Jet Car ([[dESPERADO ROCKET CHAIRS,|Desperado Rocket Chairs]]). There's a hint of tragedy to Tavros' character that I think comes through here - His melody kinda builds up but just as he's about to act it kinda fades back down. Ah well... The world's smallest violin is playing the intro trumpet section to Tavros' original theme here.\n\n3:15 - Kanaya, being quite graceful and yet incredibly deadly ([[Virgin Orb]]). She pretty much stops the music and focuses all attention on her - Something she'll do again in the future. I really like the opening of Kanaya's theme, so this is one of my fave bits. The chainsaw is also quite a fun touch.\n\n3:34 - Equius decides to step in and show people how it's done with the might and efficiency only a highb100d could bring, and indeed he probably would, but Nepeta keeps being silly and sneaking in some attacks ([[Horschestra]] & [[Walls Covered in Blood]]). It was a bit of a faff combining these two, but I liked the idea of Equius' almost military like anthem being interrupted by Nepeta's calypso funkiness.\n\n3:53 - Feferi and Eridan move in ([[Keepers]]). These two have worked together before, and provide a potent force against the King.\n\n4:13 - The King responds once again.\n\n4:36 - Sollux and Aradia decide to now get involved having kept the King psychic powers in check ([[The La2t Frontiier]] & [[psych0ruins|Psych0ruins]]). I took more or less the openings of both themes and tried gluing them together. There's also an additional bit influenced by Aradia's in the 2nd half.\n\n4:56 - Based on Karkat's description on what Gamzee's contribution to the fight was, I figured having Gamzee 'parody' the King's theme worked better here. The music doesn't even really imply what his attack was, only that it built up, was unleashed, and surprised the hell out of everyone...\n\n5:14 - The King's nearly defeated and getting desperate.\n\n5:39 - Vriska steps up, and finishes it. With one impossi8ly lucky roll.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (album organizer)\n\nI'm incredibly flattered to have such an awesome track feature so many pieces of music by myself... another miracle from the guy who brought you [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime]], folks.\n\nDefinitely the peak of intensity on the album.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/rex-duodecim-angelus.png\" width=\"300\">"

She's a gal with a knack for justice and has the force under her thumb. He's a guy who just joined the APD and finding his bearings is about as easy as feeding a Gyclops his cough syrup. And together, they are Trollcops.)\n\n(It isn't going to be easy teaching the rookie the ropes of the force, but she's the only one who can do it without getting him killed. So far the biggest problem they've hit is striking the right chord with each other. It seems like whenever they're partners, there isn't a moment when they're not both at each other's throats. It's gonna take a miracle to find a middle road with this pair, and keep their antics [[track:under-the-hat-lofam|under the hat]].)\n\n(However, if it weren't for that kartheft, the team would'a never gotten their issues ironed out. Now, they stick together like glue and macaroni and keep Alternia shining like a green sun. One thing's for sure, if you cause trouble in their neighborhood, these two will sort you out quick, because together, they are...trollcops.)",

Most of them do a great job of contributing to the idea of a videogame based on Homestuck, though - so please use your imagination when you queue them up, and wish really hard!\n\nI used Mega Man X2 samples (by daveeeey) for this track. If Nepeta had a level in a Mega Man X game, this is probably something like what it would sound like... it's just a little bit like [Neon Tiger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J67r4IEC5Mw), but maybe just in the chords. They both have the same claw weapons. Neon Tiger probably pounces because he likes Mega Man X. Time to update my shipping wall!!!\n\nI really think the toms in the opening do a good job of setting a \"jungle\" feel to the track. Same with the roaring cymbals and the jumpy bassline. The orchestra hits have a bunch of cool effects on them, too - vibrato, echo, pan, pitch shift... all within the limitations of something a SNES could do! Although I probably went over the instrument limitations for the system, especially if sound effects are involved...\n\nOh! The name of the level was contributed by my friend Samantha.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/catapult-capuchin.jpg\" width=\"300\" warning=\"decapitation\">"

It starts out with some mystical, deep-sea vibraphones, rolling cymbals like waves washing through the piece... then plays some more beach-like music, which has just a hint of brassy regality to it. The solo is a bit emotional, kinda back and forth between happy and tempestuous, but that's how it is between moirails.\n\nEridan is DEFINITELY the boss of this level.\n\nShame that Fef doesn't get a really Feffy track to herself on this album. Poor Fef. BUT if you ARE looking for that and don't mind skipping over somewhere else, go back to the Squiddles Album and check out [[Carefree Princess Berryboo|\"Carefree Princess Berryboo\"]] by Alex Rosetti.

They once fought on the battlefield as their respective nemeses, only to be united by a common epiphany - the truth behind the Ultimate Riddle. Gazing upon the Skaian clouds, the secrets of the past, present, and future are now well guarded by these strange sentinels who spread enlightenment through their cryptic music and dance. Together, they hope their songs may be a beacon to all those who undertake the Riddle.*\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20110714053512/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/), excerpt)\n\n<b>Two Albums</b>\n\n[[album:homestuck-vol-7|Homestuck Volume 7: At the Price of Oblivion]], and... a solo album by Michael Guy Bowman called Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido\n\nOn the solo album: [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|M.G. Bowman]] has done a lot to shape the sound of Homestuck. Among his contributions were [[Explore]] and [[Sburban Jungle]] (end of acts 2 and 3 music). He is also a mastermind behind the ambitious [Hare Force One](https://web.archive.org/web/20110716223444/http://www.iambowman.com/hareforceone/) project (people ship Con Air bunnies to each other all over the globe). For his album, he has created two characters whose names are featured in the title. They exist somewhere in the Homestuck universe, playing their own session, and each song captures something about their adventure. See his [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20110630045842/http://www.iambowman.com/) for what he has to say about it personally. I think it's a really fun and creative album with a fantastic sound.\n\n[[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia Morra]] and [[artist:richard-gung|Richard Gung]], both art team contributors, worked on the art for this album together. Tavia and Michael themselves actually [[track:chain-of-prospit|dress up as the characters]] and [[track:beta-version|pose in the album graphics]]. These are serious entertainers, folks.\n\n<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (excerpts from [New Album Q&A](https://web.archive.org/web/20110630045842/http://www.iambowman.com:80/))\n\n> Is there a linear story to this album, or is it some other form of story telling?\n\nI've seen a good handful of questions like this and I'd be glad to clear this up. This album does have characters and a story behind it, but it is not a linear story or a rock opera. It's an eponymous album by its members Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido.\n\nBack when Andrew proposed the music project in March of 2009, he made it clear that one of the things he wanted to do was create a lot of \"fake bands\" which would exist as actual musical entities within the Homestuck Universe in much the same light as the Gorillaz, the Monkees, or the Chipmunks (wow, those are all animal names). While we accomplished that somewhat with albums like \"Squiddles Singalong\", most of the concept albums have largely been musical homages to the actual characters. For example the Felt didn't \"make\" their album of the same name, the music team made it as program music.\n\n*Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido* is meant to be literally an album that Mobius and Hadron would make together. Like the Kernelsprites, they spread their knowledge of Sburb and <u>The Ultimate Riddle</u> cryptically through overtly complex riddles rendered as rock music. They have a seemingly limitless knowledge of all things in the Homestuck universe, or do they? For all their answers they don't just give anything away, they tease you with their songs.\n\nHoohoohoo!\n\n> How much thought did you put into connecting the album with Homestuck? Or was it just supposed to be a silly thing with a loose connection?\n\nFrom the very beginning I wanted to make this an album for Homestuck fans, but I also wanted this to be something which could be listened to from the outside-in. My goal was to create a solid set of songs that would revisit the basic themes of Homestuck, meaning that the fans would get a whole new dimension to the world of Homestuck and listeners unfamiliar with the comic could discover listen to it and, if so intrigued, discover the entire world of MSPA to create context for the album. Think of it as the relationship between *House of Leaves* and the band Poe - there is intertextuality between the literature and music and together they create a bigger picture. Plus, you can discover them in whatever order you like.\n\nPersonally, I believe the album is very faithful to the basic ideas of Homestuck. All the big themes are there: time, eternity, repetition, survival, the unknown, fractals, betrayal, dreams, romance, hypnosis, pumpkins, etc. While I certainly had ideas for songs already floating around before the fake band project fell in my lap, my rule of thumb was to incorporate Homestuck any time I hit a dead-end and didn't know what to do. Plus, the process of planning the art was something that Tavia and I were working on from almost the very beginning.\n\n> how much of the instrumentation was synthesized and how much of it was organic? i'm thinking specifically of the fiddly guitar bits in forever\n\nI play every instrument on this record, and all the ones that aren't real instruments I either played through a synthesizer or sequenced myself. All the guitar is real guitar played by myself. I did all of the singing except for some backup vocals by Tavia. About half of the bass parts are me playing an old P-Bass and the other half are some spectacularly vintage-sounding synth basses that I sequenced. While I do play drums, I was unable to use my drum set in the making of this album and instead spent an intense amount of time laying down the drum parts as the first step in making each track. Most of the performance side of the album was really quick and just involved running through the song and playing a midi keyboard run through patches.\n\nThe \"fiddly guitar bits\" are played on a white Epiphone Les Paul named Glinda.\n\n> Are there any intentional song similarities or specific inspirations, musically? Chain of Prospit reminds me a LOT of She Blinded Me With Science by Thomas Dolby, in a very good way.\n\nNone of the songs are supposed to sound intentionally like any other song, but my style is informed by the groups I've listened to that I really enjoy. I can see the resemblance, but when I listen to my own music I always hear a demolition derby of every song I've ever liked. All the things I've seen posted about my music being a mix between groups like Daft Punk, David Bowie, or They Might Be Giants really satisfy me because those are most of the same things I listen to.\n\nI think I listened to \"She Blinded Me With Science\" a lot about five years ago. Thomas Dolby is a cool guy. I really like his soundtrack to Gate to the Mind's Eye.\n\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\n\n> Also any fun stories you can share from taking the pictures for the graphics?\n\nFor the portrait of Hadron's face, I cobbled together my little lighting and shooting rig with the following: tripod, camera, music stand, orange extension cord, nightlight, and a chair. It was super guerrilla, if you consider shooting in the comfort of your own home guerrilla. Either way, it was actually a very pleasant photoshoot that didn't require an extensive amount of time to set up.\n\nOh, and I kept eating cookies during one of the photoshoots.\n\nThat's all I can remember at the moment. Bowman might remember more.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110603145529/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido))\n\nAlbum art by [[artist:tavia-morra]] and [[artist:richard-gung]]",

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n\n\"Lies With the Sea\" is one of two songs based on sketches from dreams that I put on Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido - the other, aptly enough, is \"Dawn of Man\".\n\nDuring the time I was initially formulating a concept for a fake band during the summer of 2010, I thought it would be interesting to do something with a nautical theme. One night as I was falling asleep, I very vividly imagined a melody and accompanying refrain \"my heart so full of love\", which I sketched and eventually transformed into \"my heart lies with the sea\" to fit the concept. Ultimately I ditched the nautical theme for the band after Squiddles! Sing-along came out and resolved to develop the concept that became Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido with Tavia. However, the song was already well-developed by that point and I opted to keep it around.\n\nMy first sketch for that piece was actually a lot heavier - I produced a version over that summer as a demo for Andrew that featured a slow, dirge-like drum beat and an incredibly loud guitar riff that somewhat resembled the song \"Grease\" from the way-overrated musical of the same name. Perhaps later I'll do some touch-ups to this \"heavy\" version of the song and share it, but until then I'd rather keep it to myself, being so primitively produced.\n\nOne thing it has in common with the quicker, more lightly-produced version of the track I put out in May was a fairly strong inspiration from modern electronic acts. I drew farily heavily from the sensibilities of Gorillaz in chosing synthesizer sounds on tracks like \"Rhinestone Eyes\" and \"El Ma&ntilde;ana\" and also pretty closely studied the mix on Daft Punk's \"Something About Us\", a down tempo track I greatly admire.\n\nThe thing that most strongly made me feel comfortable using this track on Mobius Trip and Hadron Kaleido was its inspiration from dreams and the sense that it generally echoed the thought of being swept away in a wave as mentioned in \"Dawn of Man\" earlier on the album. Originally I even recorded an alternate lyric to the melody of \"Sburban Jungle\" to open the second verse which I ditched that went as follows:\n\n\"Down, down far below, somewhere safe/ Lost in the wave once again.\""

AND IT KEEPS BEING TRUE EVERY TIME I SAY IT.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20110603145524/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/homestuck-vol-7-at-the-price-of-oblivion))\n\nMusic by:<br>\n[[artist:malcolm-brown]]<br>\n[[artist:michael-guy-bowman]]<br>\n[[artist:clark-powell|Clark 'Plazmataz' Powell]]<br>\n[[artist:kalibration|Robert Blaker]]<br>\n[[artist:toby-fox|Toby 'Radiation' Fox]]<br>\n[[artist:alex-rosetti|Alexander Rosetti]]<br>\n[[artist:erik-scheele|Erik 'Jit' Scheele]]<br>\n[[artist:tensei|Joren 'Tensei' de Bruin]]<br>\n[[artist:thomas-ferkol|Thomas 'EidolonOrpheus' Ferkol]]<br>\n[[artist:robert-j-lake]]<br>\n[[artist:curt-blakeslee]]<br>\n[[artist:buzinkai|George Buzinkai]]<br>\n[[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark Hadley]]",

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nSo it's the music forum discussion, and there's talk about albums representing each of the kids and discussions on what the styles would be. Some are obvious (like say, Dave) and some are offering a bit more discussion. It comes to Rose and there's a degree of uncertainty, and I suggest that it'd be veering into classical, offering up Saint-Saëns \"Dance Macabre\" as an example of the sort of thing I'd expect, and then set out to whip something up.\nAnd at this point in the story Rose's set on flying her dream self with the tumor into the green sun to destroy it (Ah remember those days). In a tried and true effort of \"trying to predict where Hussie will take the story and make music for it\" BR/GS was scribed as a \"very sad, yet hopeful, song about Rose's eventual sacrifice\" - Hence why it all builds up to a big creshendo and then fades away (and why it's called Black Rose / Green Sun , although there's another reason for that as explained below)\nThe whole thing is based on yet another piece I made years ago and drafted it out of retirement and made it into something new and useful. The music box was one of the key elements, representing a kind of creepy childlike innocence, and then Rose's signature instrument (the violin, although the sample used is actually a viola and the notes it plays are closer to a cello) begins to kind of build up. Eventually we see the majesty of the green sun, and the rest of the song builds up to the tumors destruction. (All of which never happened even remotely in this way but that's what the song was supposed to be about anyway). The overall style is a kind of very sinister attempt at representing something small vs something huge - Original inspiration was taken from the style of music from Xenogears (Yasunori Mitsuda, being very celtic and awesome).\nThe scratchy-sfx were my attempt at auralising the green sun's \"scratch\" effect. I'm not 100% convinced they work but Andrew kept 'em in so whatever.\nWhen Andrew asked to use it, it was going to be for a walkaround, so I needed to make some adjustments to make it loopable for the flash. For the album, I added a second section with a keytar solo (I was mucking about with it at the time) to make it a bit more interesting. Ultimatly it ended up being used for something completely different than originally intended, and oddly the name (\"Black Rose\") became oddly apt once she went all grimdark and tried to fight Jack (\"Green Sun\").\nThe name was also a reference to a Sonata Arctica song, similarly titled involving colours, except it was called \"White Pearl, Black Oceans\"."

The original sort of concept was something like the music of Guilty Gear - All guitars and organs and the like. It took several attempts to try and tone it into something useful, but in the end I decided to dig up Chorale for Jaspers - A previous bit of music used for representing the death of Rose's cat (The main themes here being the death of Rose's mother and the anger she feels afterwords).\nSo that's where we start, with a kind of messed up, creepy violin rendition of Chorale for Jaspers, before we start to build up and then kick into the main part of the song. Around 1:00 we here the music box chords from Black Rose/ return, then at 1:20 it's another Keytar Solo from me (I'd just bought it and was feeling cocky). The rhythm guitar and guitar solo at the end was also me and also something I was terrified to do since I don't normally do \"Live\" playing (Everything is usually sequenced). In this case, a lot of it was so difficult to do (Because I can barely play guitar. At all) at this speed most of it was played at a slower tempo and then sped up digitally (HAX!).\nThe drums were easily the funnest thing to sequence in this thing, mainly all the awesome fills and the double bass step at the end. The final guitar solo is an attempt to reference Rose's original \"Strife\" theme - Aggrieve. It's very loosely there, and I reckon needs to come back in some fashion since it's actually kind of awesome.\nWhen Andrew told me he was going to use this one for a fight scene I was looking heavily forward to it. Imagine my surprise when just as it's about to kick off... John gets himself stabbed."

The scene inspiring it was obviously Terezi's ancestor Redglare vs Vriska's ancestor Mindfang during the sort of mock-trial that ended in Mindfang mind-controlling the crowd and hanging Redglare. Felt like a nice scene to try some musical accompaniment, so I did.\nSo a combination of liking Terezi's theme and getting my hands on some new samples and voices, I decided to whip this together. The idea was a very tribal, savage kind of military march (and chanting) to represent the lower class masses baying for blood. It starts off using Lemonsnout Turnabout for Terezi, but then quickly changes to Crystalanthemums -- Specifically for the reference to \"Make Her Pay\" and Crystamanthequins as a kind of \"Vriska vs Somebody\" theme. Ideally it would've just evolved into Vriska's theme, but I find that one a bit tricky to work with.\nFinally it throws in a string glissando as tension mounts, and then snap! Dead! (The snapping is some kind of double bass string snap.)\nThe little eerie female vocalist thing didn't really work and is a bit cliched, but I kinda like the rest of the track. Always nice to give character deaths a little celebration\nThe name's fairly obvious - I was trying to work in some kind of \"Trial and Error\" gag but I guess this works."

              "Commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nAlright, as requested, I'll do some indepth commentary on already released Homestuck songs, starting off with Spider8reath.\nNow, you may have heard this from me before, but Vriska is HANDS DOWN the most fun character to write music for. It's hard to exactly pinpoint the reason for this, but something about her character just invites badass pentatonic blues riffs, squealing guitars and shrill horns all over the place.\nReally, when you pick it apart, this song is actually very simple at its basis, containing a pretty typical blues progression, and the constantly repeated guitar/bass riff which is introduced right at the start and then just keeps on going ( dadada DA dada DA dada dada dadadada, it's really fun to sing along actually!)\nThe horn section actually adds the bulk of the songs 'gravy', providing lots of switch-ups, sometimes playing in unison with the main riff, sometimes splitting up and providing countermelodies or underlining the harmonized guitars. It was also by far the hardest part to write because I had literally no previous experience with brass writing, but I got some great feedback from other music team members.\nActually part of the reason that it was so hard to implement is probably because the song was already more or less 'done' before I thought of putting in a few brass stabs here and there. Then as I was writing the brass became more and more of a foreground element, and that's how Spider8reath became the screamy shrill funfest that it is now.\nPeople who said that the exposed guitar solo at the start reminded them of Van Halen were totally right, because the song 'Eruption' was more or less a direct inspiration for it. I think it turned out really well, and it serves as a great intro to the song!\nReally though, the main inspiration for this song simply comes from building on the previous Vriska songs that Radiation did. While the brass was a new, spur-of-the-moment addition, the guitar riffs and melodies were always supposed to be reminiscent of stuff like Spider's Claw, Killed by Br8k Spider and MeGaLoVaNia. People definitely seem to associate this song with Vriska too now, so mission accomplished I guess?"

Homestuck didn't have one, so off I went to fix that!\nThe original plan was \"Showtime in the style of a soaring, brass-filled JRPG Airship theme (ala Highwind, Ragnarawk takes to the skies, Wings etc.) and that's where the first bits come from. Around about 0:56 I wanted to try some cool chord progression as a kind of extension of John's theme (Something I've used in future i.e. Do You Remem8er Me). Someone's recently since pointed out this sounds like the theme of Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story which is kind of annoying, since I'd never heard that before and it completely does. Still, I stand by it."

Things changed though.  Once I had actually started writing and refining it, I decided to change its message, from a mad owl thing to the mysterious demon in the troll's session which had been [recently mentioned](https://www.homestuck.com/story/2606) in the comic (I wrote this sometime in Fall 2010).  Also, yes, that is why there is distorted owl screeches at the end, although they were more meant to evoke the horrorterrors crying out in pain than owls by the time it was finished.  Contains some very powerful organ and some great chord progressions, but also some structural choices I am not completely proud of, which remained in the piece until its release months and months later because the original Finale file crashed on me before I had a chance to save it.  So, rather than attempt reconstructing it, I went with what I had, and it stuck.\n\n<i>Thomas Ferkol:</i> (composer, [YouTube comments](https://youtu.be/E7pBfnN7b1w))\n\nDarkleer had no actual connection to my writing of the piece, was actually a Lord English in the outer ring piece. Someone choosing track art just thought he fit for some reason?\n\n> WHAT IS THAT TERRIFYING SOUND?! The end of this song is freaking me out.\nBarn Owl put through distortion. Possibly horrorterrors. Who knows, man, who knows..\n> Well I have a stud horse (stallion), and this kind of sounds like him whinnying slowed down.\n\nBarn Owl through distortion, was supposed to be horrorterror sounds, but the person gathering art for the album chose this picture.\n\n> <p>considering it was originally written about lord english, i'd assume the vast honk?</p>\n> <p><i>...(another commenter)...</i></p>\n> <p>No? We HEAR it, and it's him saying honk, not random screaming that is supposedly a honk</p>\n\nBeen a while, but the noises are the horrorterrors being slaughtered"

First main goal was some kind of Doctor remix, on the ground that I never actually did one (Took my hiatus around the time of Vol 5.) so this was partially a jokey attempt to \"Join in the fun\". Secondary goal was mainly a combination of liking the track this is mostly based on (Waking World) and the concept of Godhood ascension (Didn't have a particular character in mind at the time). There's also a little bit of wanting to try some new instrument samples (Namely choir and guitar) so there was a bit of experimentation in this one too.\nThe working title for this one was \"Doctor on the Bridge\", because the choir instrumentation at the start reminded me a bit of \"The Bridge of Khazad-dûm\" (the bit after Gandalf dies in the LOTR movie). The final product aimed at being a bit closer to the original SotWW so I gave it a kind of darker twist - \"Dreaming Dead\" worked quite well as a title and Homestuck concept (And kept the alliteration). The ending I like, it channels a bit of danger and kickass before ending rather uncertainly. I wasn't fully 100% on this one to begin with - There were parts I liked and parts I didn't - And it's not as faithful a 'Doctor/Waking World' homage as it could be... The mastering also isn't brilliant - Quite bass heavy in places.\nBut. After it was used in Cascade, particularly with Rad's additions to the ending and generally going along to the animation of Jade Being Awesome and Universes Being Destroyed it's hard for me not to like it now - Particularly when the end cuts hit and everything's starting to head towards disaster. I don't think it's one of my best, and I would love to go back and try making it better, but I'm happy enough that it was used at one of the biggest moments in the comic, and still stands as a fairly harmless, simple and straightforward bit of music."

Hadley:</i>\nNot long after I made Sburban Countdown, I made a version that rewinds back to the beginning again and called it 'Sburban Reversal', just in case it might be useful someday. Andrew ended up using part of it in act 2 except for the actual reversing part, but still credited it as 'Sburban Reversal', which had people asking me constantly after that if it's a real song. It wasn't really anything except for the reversing, so I eventually decided to extend it out to a full song. Since it was never actually fully in the comic, I recommended it as a bonus track.\n<i>Raizor:</i> ([Tumblr](https://raizor-blog.tumblr.com/post/4736228505/dave-hurry-up-and-get-in-the-fucking-game))\n\\>Dave: Hurry up and get in the fucking game\n<img src=\"media/misc/sburban-reversal-full.png\" width=\"450\">"

What ended up happening was the creation of twelve powerful pieces that are close and dear to me and are a road map of my trials. The album has a biblical theme with the titles as to fit with the concept of the story of Homestuck being that of creation. Sburb ends up being the catalyst for the existence of our universes and every other one. I hope you appreciate them!

It actually came about from me trying to figure out the chords the harps play in the quiet last section of Saturn from Gustav Holst's The Planets. When I started writing Sburb I decided that it would fit perfectly with the theme that the game creates. The structure of the chords is not unlike how the game actually functions. They work as a juxtaposition of good and evil by using relative major and minor chords. It starts off quietly and on higher octaves to introduce the mood. The next section brings in the [[Homestuck Anthem]] as an introduction to the album itself, signaling the beginning of the entire process. The piece suddenly grows in intensity as the left hand C octave ostinatos enter the phrases followed by the calm of the storm. The piece does not resolve, however it does lead straight into [[Genesis|the next]].\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nThe introduction to the suite lays the fundamentals and ideas present throughout the rest of the movements. A juxtaposition between major and minor are in every chord creating a backbone of polytonality that I wanted to explore as I formulated the album.\n\nThe main [[Homestuck Anthem|Homestuck anthem]] is weaved through the chords as this album was originally written for and published through MS Paint Adventures and What Pumpkin. The original theme was composed by [[artist:clark-powell|Clark Powell]].\n\nThe album in its entirety is performed by [[artist:erik-scheele|Erik Scheele]]."

Genesis marks the beginning of the biblical terms as well. The Book of Genesis is the first book of both the Hebrew Bible and Christian Old Testament. It is interpreted as the Chosen People being lead to the Promised Land. Sburb is the pathway that leads the kids into the game that is suppose to eventually grow a new universe. It starts off quietly and builds into a fast paced journey. Genesis also introduces my favorite music technique: hemiolas. The right hand plays a melody in triplets while the left hand harmonizes in eighth notes. This creates a strange rhythm and continues the juxtaposition theme created in [[The Prelude]]'s chords. Continuing the concept of two extremes but together, the song goes into legato, quiet phrases that are immediately followed by staccato, loud phrases.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\n[[The Prelude|The previous track]] sets up the resolution that the opening measures provide here. This movement introduces the two against three polyrhythm idea that continues throughout the album as well as a few choice hemiolas. Coming from a percussion background, I find a lot of melodic potential in rhythmic content and this whole suite was a place for me to test that out."

It is suppose to be a beautiful, blissful utopia. It also becomes the origin of sin. The piece reflects that concept. The flowing and adventurous nature of the piece is suppose to reflect the beauty and majestic qualities of the land. As far as the kids story goes, it represents the infinite potential of Skaia. This song also continues the same hemiola motif as [[Creation]] with triplets played by the right hand and eighth notes played by the left. The glissandos at the beginning and in the middle is an E flat pentatonic run, which basically means I only played on the black keys. Since it's completely ad libbed I wrote out a small little example. Basically, the left hand just continues up normally while the right hand goes back and forth while slowly climbing up (if looking at the sheet music, each note alternates on the hands).\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nThe goal here was to feel like a breath of air after the first two movements had a much more minor modal center. The three over two polyrhythm keeps powering through the movement as I start introducing bass ostinati that act as the pedal tone to the melodic content.\n\nStill in love with those flourishes after all these years."

In Sburb, the players must go through a set of tasks to escape impending doom. This song reflects the process of entering the medium. This is why I encorporated [[Sburban Jungle]] into the beginning and end. The first time Sburb is booted up you hear [[Sburban Jungle (Brief Mix)|a bit]] of Sburban Jungle, just like at the beginning of the song you hear the bottom chords. Later, when John enters the medium (as well as Rose) you hear the song in more complete forms like the end of the piece. When playing, the trickiest part is definitely the triplet ostinato that continues throughout the entire song. The best method to pulling this off is by playing the note on the beat (which will always be either E flat or G) with the left hand and the rest of the notes on the right hand. You will notice that when there are lower notes, there are rests in the ostinato so that you can quickly jump down the piano.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nContinuing the Homestuck homages, this piece prominently features the bassline from [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|Michael Guy Bowman's]] [[Sburban Jungle]].\n\nWhen I was writing this movement I really wanted to explore how much I could utilize the different registers of the piano while keeping a constant ostinato running through the middle register."

One portion of Homestuck never focused on is the direct aftermath of the destruction of the Reckoning. Requiem is a theme for all the people and things lost on Earth. The song itself could be very tricky to play depending on how familiar you are with time signatures. The piece is in 4/4 for the majority of the first half. It enters a 5/4 section with a 4/4 continuation of the \"siren\" effect overlapping. The hemiola only occurs the first time, the second time bringing in a 5/4 melody to accompany it. Immediately afterwards the piece shifts into mixed meter. The 7/8 section is briefly interupted by an apostrophe of 5/8. The ending shifts to 6/8 as the tone shifts from minor to major.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nContinuing my quest to explore rhythm and melody, Requiem's goal was to keep a melody whipping between different time signatures while not feeling jerky or sudden.\n\nI tried to hide the resolution at the end by having a quiet final note low in the bass after the bell like ringing of the final major arrival to add finality while also trying to let the unresolved final chord linger. Erik's performance really nailed it."

They are the ones left to fix and save the Earth 413 years after its destruction. It starts off solemn as the concept occurs to them that it is their duty to repopulate and rebuild. As the piece goes on it gets more intense to reflect all of the shenanigans and gun pointing that occurs as they all converge and meet. After the tension dies away the mood from before is recapped before resolving at the end. However, the last run ends in dissonance, because we don't know how the exile's story will play out.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nA really terrible engraving job on the sheet music by yours truly created a repeated note in the beginning motive that I ended up actually digging more than the original version.\n\nThe Meek continues the idea of bouncing between time signatures while trying to keep a sense of structure. Where [[track:requiem]] was more about a constant pulse, I decided to play with elongated pauses to stretch the phrases.\n\nThe second section was during a time where I was really starting to love the idea of modes and modal mixture and just had fun with it. Still one of my favorite passages from the entire album!\n\nI also really love not resolving these movements, if you haven't noticed."

Chronicles is a piano version of [[Candles and Clockwork]]. Candles and Clockwork in itself is a massive hemiola as each voice exists in a different time signature. The melody is adapted in this piece to match the 3/4 arpeggio. The piece keeps changing to reflect each leg of the journey the kids have to experience in order to finish the game, not necessarily in order.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nChronicles is an adaption of an earlier Homestuck track I wrote, [[Candles and Clockwork]]. It was one of the first compositions I ever finished and, true to form, is a big hemiola. I wanted an ostinato in a different time signature than the melody which is what I focus on during the first section as I introduce the melody.\n\nThe second part of the song introduces the final major motive of the suite, a sextuplet accompaniment outlining the tonic and dominant. A staple of the western art canon, it was a good foundation for me to work on some melodies that weren't purely rhythmic noodling."

The sirens lead into a fast paced hectic section before dying down as quickly as it appeared. A sudden destructive force that comes and goes in an instant. This song uses two motifs throughout the album: the siren and hemiolas. Measures 17-19 are more than a little tricky to play. I left a note in the sheet music to help with the ending line.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nRapture was the boss tune of the suite. The big bad of the album, it brings back the bass and sustain pedal heavy ostinato while trying to juxtapose a simple and quiet melody that bookends it."

              "Commentary": "<i>James Dever:</i> (composer's notes)\n\nThe song that means more to me than any song I've ever written and possibly will again. Sburb is all about creating worlds, thus the resolution of the album comes after the storm ([[Rapture]]). No matter how harsh the process may be, the result is beauty and endless potential. This song is completely based around the hemiola motif and the origin of it. It is also designed like a day. The song starts off quiet and slow as the sun rises and slowly gets more complex and full fledged as it rises until mid day when it is most busy. As the sun sets into the later half of the day the song slows down and gets quieter toward the sunset. It resolves with the [[Homestuck Anthem]] to imply the loop to the beginning. Worlds are created and the process of Skaia starts again.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nThis movement is framed as a sunset. Starting off quiet, building to a peak before shying away to where it started.\n\nYou can definitely see that I was influenced into writing music from the works of Philip Glass and that is in full force here, but even in retrospect I feel like I put a great personal spin on it.\n\nAs the sun sets, there's a final recall of the [[Homestuck Anthem]]. This movement was originally the last movement before I added the Revelations movements but it fit too well and I could not bring myself to remove it.\n\nI wrote this the weeks following the passing of my grandmother. It will always be for her and for everything she did for me."

The three songs were added months after the original nine were finished and pieced together into the album. They are a standalone piece from the rest of the album but still fit the concept of Sburb and Skaia. Revelations is the equivalent of The Ultimate Riddle. Solving and understanding is the purpose behind the entire concept, however it can completely be overlooked and is not necessary to completing the rest of the process. Thousands of people can play the game and create their own universes but never quite solve the riddle. In this sense, it completely is a separate entity because the other nine songs can loop freely with or without its presence. Each of the movements is based around the same arpeggio pattern featured in [[Chronicles]]. They are another journey completely.\n\nThe first movement starts off as a note in the distance, a growing concept. To the sound of a siren it grows and rushes into a full blown idea. The [[Homestuck Anthem]] is briefly mentioned to imply a connection but it just keeps going leaving it in the dust. There are better things to get to. It slowly breaks down and flows into the next movement.\n\n<i>James Dever:</i> (Bandcamp rerelease)\n\nRevelations is a three part finale that is completely centered on the sextuplet dominant/tonic motive introduced earlier in the album. Each movement was more exploration of how I can use the same general accompaniment but completely change the melody."

This piece is actually pretty old, going back to before [[album:homestuck-vol-5|Volume 5]], where it was much simpler (playing out more like a round) and with poorer sound quality in general. Like most of my music it was inspired by a similar piece from somewhere else - in this case, [the original Bionicle flash adventure game](https://biomediaproject.com/bmp/play/web-games/mnog/) that used to be on the Lego website way back. If you've played it, you might notice the similarity, at least as far as instrumentation goes. It had been many years since I'd last even seen the game, long after it fell off the site, so I couldn't recognise what I liked about the piece and so the imitation I'd made was pretty poor!\n\nFast forward a year or two. Some discussion with internet friends had led me to find that old flash game again, and I heard my old favourite tune in all its glory (significantly less glorious than I remembered; nostalgia does that to you). Still, it showed me the main place I was going wrong, which was that I'd neglected harmony. All of the three or four lines of music that piece had were monophonic, making a really drab sound, while what I needed where chords. A stupid mistake? Sure, it was, but then, I wasn't that good a musician when I first wrote the piece. I started over, applying all the experience I'd got both from writing music and simply listening to it with a critical ear to get my main contribution to the Wanderers album, and something I could be proud of."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nAaah this one. This caused me a bit of unexpected grief, but we'll get to that.\nBasically, I wanted to do some kind of Parcel Mistress/PM theme. Representing her transition from postal worker, to warrior, to queen. We start off quite desolate, and we gradually build up to a kind of royal, celtic march.\nThe instrumentation is a bit all over the place (bagpipes, panpipes, probably an Oud somewhere as well). Most of it was attempting to channel various stereotypical \"World Music\" concepts into one track (We're dealing with the remnants of Earth as a setting, so one idea is a kind of combination of different cultural styles - It doesn't fully work, since it's mostly just the instrumentation applied to a fairly simple layout and melody).\nAs for the melody itself, I quite like it - It's very playful and jumpy, yet brings a sense of duty, which fits quite well. Explore also makes an appearance during the kind of transitional \"Wandering\" segment. Also because I really like Explore.\nThe name, and it's worth mentioning I've done incorrect translations before (see Rex Duodecim Latinus), is supposed to be \"Royal Mail\" in Scots Gaelic. It's a bit of a strange pun on PM as a character...\nNow onto controversy!\nAs a few people pointed out when they first heard it, that the notes starting from 0:20 onwards by the sitar are viciously close if not identical to the start of Schala's theme from Chrono Trigger. And yes, yes they are. There is a subtle difference but the majority of the phrase matches. Depending on who you ask this ranges from either an atrocity or an inevitability given the limited nature of conventions and structure of music.\nPersonally, the reference was unintentional. Let's get this straight also, I'm a ludicrously huge Yasunori Mitsuda fanboy. I'm not fully ruling out that at some level I was remembering ST when making LR, but I honestly could not recall the song until someone linked a video, and even afterwards I don't recall the song from the game. There are tonnes of tracks from CT that I recall fondly but ST just isn't one of them. This all said, there was no malevolence nor deceit intended when writing LR and I apologise to anyone offended by it.\nThat's really all I have to say on the matter."

To hear one night those muted pawpads traipse up your stairs. A low but friendly growl unsettles your slumber, and as the sopor seeps from your eyes they detect a sharp pair of ears cutting moonlight. A mysterious wolven tongue invites. Wouldn't these ears suit you? Would not this proud long snout assist you in the hunt?\nWhat a daring dream...\n(Just what do you think you're planning on doing with that ring?)<br>(Whatever it is forget it)<br>(The Slayer is miiiiiiiine)<br>(Now w8ke up)<br>(I said W88888888KE!)",
              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThe Wanderers is my favorite Homestuck album. Its focused premise, interesting takes on a theme, and general aesthetic all appeal to me. Not to mention the fact that it contains some of the best songs in the Homestuck discography. This song is not one of those.\nI don't mean to sell myself short, but What a Daring Dream is hard to appreciate on its own as music, and this was intentional. As a matter of fact, I wrote it to underscore WV's dream sequence, which is one of my favorite parts of Homestuck. And even then, my approach wasn't as programmatic as Malcolm's, as he had the same idea with his track, Nightmare. Funny enough, we even ended up giving our pieces the same title, but he was generous enough to change his so that I could keep mine. Of course, because of this the two songs compliment each other very well, and make for a great double-closer to the album.\nI composed What a Daring Dream long before we officially started production on The Wanderers. I actually made the first version of it very shortly after that update came out, it being one of those quick flashes of inspiration. In terms of musical influence, there are a few musical cues from Neon Genesis Evangelion that sounded like the direction I wanted to take. All the ones I listened to had this sort of \"stuck in your own head\" sort of approach to them, which of course is very suited to their subject matter, and that was the reason I thought this sort of music would be perfect for my piece.\nI wanted the music to be very hazy and meditative, very much like a dream (naturally). Unclear sounds fading in and out, soft messages you're not quite sure you're hearing. The use of Morse code was an obvious choice, though I did not have the patience to translate every single line of code in that sequence. I just used the same sample repeatedly, altered it a bit, and panned the two versions of it to each side of the mix. I did, however, think it would be worth my time to whisper the English translation of the Morse code, so throughout the piece you hear my voice narrating ever so slightly in the background, even up to Vriska's dialogue.\nThe instrumentation was a lucky coincidence since I modeled parts of it off the Evangelion score, and those happened to fit the very broad \"Eastern music\" theme we were going for for the most part. So the piece turned out to be a great candidate for the album and I worked on it a lot more before submitting it to be on there. Overall it was one of the most fun songs I've had the pleasure of making for Homestuck, and the fact that it spooked some people is an added bonus.\nSpeaking of bonuses, Noot did the art we used for this track. It was one of a few pieces of track art that weren't commissioned. I happened to be looking around for artists and saw this, and I already knew it was perfect."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nThis one was a bit weird, and went through several revisions trying to figure out what to do. It's loosely designed to be a bit of music for WV's dream in which he effectively turns into Bec Noir and starts killing everything before Vriska turns up disguised as Serenity and makes the whole sequence even weirder.\nFirstly, the concept - It starts of quite dreamlike, then as we get to 1:40 the transformation starts, then there's some more preamble up to around 2:45 onewards, which is the \"Red Miles\" section where everything starts to go haywire. In betwixt there's lots of creepy choirs, weird noises and distorted barking all set to a kind of pseudo Egyptian theme (One working title was 'Anubis')\nHidden around 0:25 onwards is a kind of very subtle reference to Black and an even subtler reference to RDA. After that it's mostly original.\nThere are various samples hidden around the place, like wolf barks and jackal howling. Also all sorts of bizarre human laughter/screaming/conversation that's been reversed and distorted. Then we get to 2:45 and I attempt to kick it into a kind of bizarre Trailer-music affair with a ridiculous amount of percussion and a lot of staccato strings. Oh and those big brass drones everyone loves these days.\nThe ending (3:50 odd) attempts to mimic the beginning of Carapacian Dominion, to act as a kind of bookend for the album. It doesn't do it perfectly, but that's my fault :P\nI quite like this one. I'm not fully sold on the odd sound effects since they're always a bit gimmicky, but the overall theme kinda works. The name was fairly obvious - I did attempt to call it \"What a daring Nightmare\" but Alex Rosetti beat me to it.\nAlso hey, 4:13. Love it when that happens."

              "Commentary": "<i>Tensei:</i>\nI always felt like this song was in a bit of an unfortunate position, being a bonus song on the Wanderers album, which basically meant that only people who bought the album or those who specifically scoured youtube for it would get to hear it.\nSo I'm gonna bring it to your attention and hopefully someone will be hearing it for the first time!\nTomahawk Head was pretty much a full-on collaborative effort between me and Radiation. We had already done some stuff together with the full version of MeGaLoVaNia, but this song was a much more even split IMO. Radiation basically wrote most of the composition in midi form, and I had the task of unleashing my samples and live guitar on it. I also did some minor rewrites, like fleshing out the acoustic middle-section as well as adding the guitar solo section.\nThis song was intended as ARs theme, and uses a lot of (stereotypically) Native American instrumentation. In that sense, it kinda reminds me of a lot of Jade/Bec themes, where there's an obvious eastern Asian vibe, even though thematically there's no real canonical connection between Jade and eastern Asian culture.\nI actually consider this a really cool use of ethnic instrumentation. It's not even the fact that it deliberately tries to go against a stereotype to make a point, but rather that it treats the ethnic instruments as any other: it makes use of the characteristics of the sounds to underline a particular situation or character, and ignores any cultural connotations of the instrument.\nWhen you think about it, it's pretty silly to assume that Jade has to be Asian because some songs associated with her use ethnic instrumentation. In that sense, I might as well claim that Rose has to be Italian, because hey, that's where violins originally came from!\nAt the end of the movie Kill Bill, there's a final showdown between The Bride and O-ren Ishii. They're both wielding katanas and the setting is a very stereotypical, snow-covered japanese garden. You would THINK that you'd at least get some taiko drums as a backing, but nope. The song that plays is \"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\" by Santa Esmeralda, which can best be described as a flamenco/disco hybrid. And it fits PERFECTLY.\nIn that sense, I think that this song too fits AR very well, even though his character has fuck-all to do with Native American culture."

August's album is brought to you by [[artist:solatrus|Jeremy \"Solatrus\" Iamurri]], creator of [[track:frost-vol6|\"Frost\"]] and [[Crystalanthology|\"Crystalanthology.\"]]\n\nNamed \"Prospit & Derse,\" this album chronicles the contrast between Skaia's two moons. Prospit's brassy fanfares, eclectic bass, and melodic piano parallel Derse's somber strings, dark synths, and dirty drums. These two soundscapes work side-by-side to create a lunar ying-yang of harmoniously smooth tracks. Dark or light, Solatrus's production efforts really shine through!\n\nSo, how about it?

And what's even more remarkable is how much I've improved as a musician since then. But let's turn the clock back and I'll tell you the story of how it all started.\n\nThis whole thing is going to be done in the order of how I created the album, which was Derse and then Prospit, but not precisely in that order.\n\n<b>Where It All Began</b>\n\nIt wasn't too long after [[album:homestuck-vol-6|Volume 6]] was released that I started debating a solo album. I knew that I enjoyed contrasts, but I really loved ethereal sounds. I had actually considered doing a Medium album, but Clark [[album:medium|beat me to it]]. However, Prospit & Derse had already been started before Medium was out.\n\nSo where did the album's concept come from? Well, a conversation I had with Lexxy, actually! We were brainstorming ideas and we got into talking about the moons, and then the idea sunk in for me to do a solo album, which was actually called Derse/Prospit (yes, slash included).\n\nPretty cool, huh? And Lexxy helped with the album cover, which is really great.\n\nBut anyway, I eventually started working on some of the music. I knew Prospit was going to be a struggle for me, because I had never written any proper orchestral music at the time. And the first song I created was [this](https://soundcloud.com/solatrus/apathy-empathy-wip-2), albeit it was in drum and bass and [not nearly](https://soundcloud.com/solatrus/apathy-empathy-wip) as polished sounding.\n\nBut I really didn't like the direction, so I ended up scrapping it and trying to figure out how to start over. And then Medium was released and I was incredibly inspired and remembered how great atmospheric music is. Clark Powell single-handedly saved this album from being killed before it even got anywhere.\n\nAnd that's when I created [[Darkened Streets]].\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> ([2020 rerelease blurb](https://solatrus.bandcamp.com/album/prospit-derse))\n\nMy solo album from Homestuck!\n\nHomestuck © Homestuck\nMusic © Solatrus\nReferences to other works © their respective artists\n\nCopyrighted material used with permission",

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (original commentary)\n\nHm, I haven't thought much about Prospit & Derse since its release, actually, but, here goes.\n\nAs you can probably tell, the two halves of the album have some parallels, especially in the first two songs: e.g., Hallowed Halls is to [[Darkened Streets]] as [[The Golden Towers|Golden Towers]] is to [[The Obsidian Towers|Obsidian Towers]]. I originally wrote Darkened Streets, but I really wanted to take the melody and progression used in it and apply it to a brassy fanfare. That's ultimately what Hallowed Halls came to be. Honestly, if it wasn't for Marcy helping me name the song, I probably wouldn't've had the right image in my head for the new arrangement.\n\nAnd Nick Smalley helped me out with those french horns, making them sound halfway decent.\n\nNot really much else other than this song and Core of Darkness are without a doubt the best two on the album.\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nThe opener for Prospit & Derse, at least, in the album's final lineup. This was actually track #5 for the longest period of time, but I realized just before release that Prospit had a stronger opening track and Derse had a stronger closing track.\n\nThis was a really fun song to create, and definitely helped set the example of how I wanted to approach Prospit for awhile. Hilariously, if you listen to how the album's set up, there's actually 4 sets of songs. Hallowed Halls and The Golden Towers have a lot of similar instruments, and are both designed as parallels to Darkened Streets and The Obsidian Towers, which also have a similar set of instruments. I ended up veering off into totally unique territory for each half's Dreamers, and ended up continuing in those new directions for the 4th tracks.\n\nA big thanks to Nick and Marcy for helping me get this particular track started. Marcy gave me some good ideas (as well as naming this song) for how to put together some of the melodic lines. Nick came along and pointed out how I should use the French Horns. So this track is almost completely why the two of them have special thanks credits on this album.\n\nIn retrospect, the song feels like it's a bit empty. For being what's supposed to be the Royal Palace of Prospit, the impact just isn't there, neither melodically nor atmospherically. It's not a bad song, but it just barely misses the mark that it deserved to hit.\n\nHowever, I absolutely adored the art Bea did for this piece, and, well, .. hey wait the art up there is different than it used to be! Yup. Bea decided to update the art for Hallowed Halls, and she did and even better job than before. Oh, and here's the fun part on this: I had no idea she actually was doing this until a few days ago, and she forgot that the anniversary was yesterday! Anyway, here's what she had to say:\n\n<i>Bea:</i>\n\ncontributing to homestuck, a webcomic thats given me so many opportunities, friends and good memories is a great honor, especially to be involved in an album as conceptually compelling and well executed as the prospit and derse album. i thank solatrus for the opportunity to be a part of his creation and everyone who helped me give back to something that has influenced my life immensely.\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i>\n\nThanks for helping me out, Bea. And keep up the good work.\n\nI have to say I'm pleased overall with this song, but, like any artist, it's difficult to look back at my works. They never seem completed. Especially the Prospit half for me.\n\n<i>Bea:</i> ([Tumblr](https://beesmygod.tumblr.com/post/189639797200/in-2011-i-was-inexplicably-tapped-to-do-album-art))\n\nin 2011 i was inexplicably tapped to do album art for a homestuck song and it was extremely terrible. i redrew it recently and i think its a nice improvement. the halls being empty fits with being the first, introductory song of the album. things are just beginning.\n\n<i>Bea:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/hallowed-halls-original.png\" width=\"300\">\n\n<i>Bea:</i> (alternate artworks, [Tumblr](https://beesmygod.tumblr.com/post/29751107342/whatevr))\n\nwhatevr\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/hallowed-halls-bonus1.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/hallowed-halls-bonus2.png\" width=\"300\">\n\n<i>Bea:</i> (alternate artwork, [Tumblr](https://beesmygod.tumblr.com/post/12870807529/ill-go-with-this-one-for-now-while-i-think-of-more))\n\nill go with this one for now while i think of more stuff to start putting in my portfolio\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/hallowed-halls-bonus3.jpg\" width=\"300\">"

Well, putting it simply this song tried too hard to be [[The Obsidian Towers]]. I really wanted to do that parallel idea with this song and its Derse counterpart more than any of the others, but I ended up trying too hard to pull off that effect. And this song suffered greatly for it.\n\nTo be fair, it's got a pretty cool twist on everything compared to Obsidian Towers, but the biggest problem with this song is that I didn't try to let it be itself. You have no idea how badly I want to redo this song. There's so much potential behind this song that, at the time, I really just didn't understand. Of course, I've learned a remarkable amount since then, and one day, hopefully soon, I will rewrite this song.\n\nHaha, I sound like I'm really tearing into my work here, don't I? Well, it used to be [[Prospit Dreamers]] that I didn't like, but more on that a little later.\n\nAs I mentioned with The Obsidian Towers, both songs suffer from being really boring compositions. While Obsidian managed to get away with it because of my production skill, this song couldn't hide behind ill beats and a deliciously dark atmosphere. So, the very inexperienced composer in me tried his best to piece together a song based on The Obsidian Towers.\n\nIs it horrible? Eh, I'll leave that judgment up to you. I know there are fans out there who really dig this song. My opinion is that it's my weakest song related to Homestuck, but really, it's not the worst thing I've ever done.\n\nI'm quite pleased with what Pride did for the art, though. It worked out really well for the song.\n\nAs an additional note, it's been pointed out to me by [this fan](http://kicking-christ-in-a-dirty-diaper.tumblr.com/) that this song sounds like it has Mark Hadley's [[track:problem-sleuth-theme|Problem Sleuth theme]] in it, at least in part. It's a coincidence in the exact same reason that [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] gets the same comment: slow melodies, probably the same key. Really nothing else to it. I've listened to Hadley's PS theme probably twice ever. Oops. Said fan also wondered if I jokingly thought that gentlemen of Team Sleuth are Prospit's agents much like our chums in the Midnight Crew are Derse's. I didn't, but that's an awesome comparison and now I'm all for it."

It was rushed, and it's, sadly, my least favorite work I've ever done. I had some interesting ideas, going with a bit of a swing flavor to it, but frankly the song sounds like I was going through ADD.\n\nIt probably doesn't help that I basically [wrote] a small, but significant, part of the song and set it aside for a few months before adding in the piano and bass parts and finishing it.\n\nAnd by rushed I mean I was actually adding to this song days before the album came out. I wouldn't recommend anyone doing that ever.\n\nStill, people seem to like the song, and to be fair, there's a few really neat parts in it. It's just, well, weak overall. I've done a lot better, and this song's 'failure,' so to speak, taught me a lot of valuable lessons.\n\nSorry if you were expecting something more positive!\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nThis song is freaking weird.\n\nNow why do I say that? Well, it doesn't really know what it wants to be. A 6/8 piece somewhat reminiscent of something from the Legend of Zelda? A 4/4 piece? A swung piece? It's... well it's all of those.\n\nProspit Dreamers is without a doubt the most ambitious song I wrote for Prospit & Derse. I did a lot of really awkward things that worked out really well, but I had absolutely no idea why any of it worked. And so I ended up really hating the song because I thought it was too random!\n\nCome a year later and I now I understand my composing style better, so when I listen to this I find it to be a pretty dang fascinating piece. A lot of individual parts making a very interesting greater whole.\n\nIf you think about the early part, it sounds like the Prospitians had created this really mellow 6/8 piece, but then John and Jade show up and mix it up with their (my headcanon) love of swing music.\n\nI'm especially pleased with how I managed to fit [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] and [[Doctor]] together into this song, along with a little bit of [[Penumbra Phantasm]], and still make the song stand on its own. It's a lot cooler sounding than what I did in [[Derse Dreamers]], honestly!\n\nMy personal favorite part is the time signature switch when the clarinets come in and play an arrangement of that familiar motif from Penumbra Phantasm, and then the strong french horns playing the same line they played in Frost behind the trumpets playing Doctor's melody.\n\nIt's really hilarious how I used to not appreciate this song, but now I do. I actually enjoy it more than most of the album, and I'm really glad that my opinion changed, and I am also really glad I asked Zoey to do the art for this song, because her art is amazing, and her interpretation of John and Jade is the best. THE BEST. Speaking of, she informed me to tell you all the following:\n\n<i>Zilleniose:</i>\n\nButts\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i>\n\nButts indeed."

B)\n\nWhile this song was started pretty late into production, it was actually one of the first in the entire album to be completed. Both [[Hallowed Halls]] and [[Center of Brilliance]] were started around the same time, and I really don't remember which came first. It's been awhile, okay?\n\nAnyway, if it wasn't one of the first to be completed, it was definitely the first. I'm actually pretty pleased with this song, because it helped me figure out the other direction I wanted to go in for Prospit.\n\nThe best part about this song is, without a doubt, the trumpet lines in the middle and near the end. While it's totally synthetic and sampled, I'm very pleased with how it sounds! I really love the section very close to the end where it's just a single trumpet and the clarinet section. It's one of the better motifs I've written, in my opinion, and I'm quite pleased with it.\n\nThat's not to say this song is perfect. The piano timing is a little too off and a little too noticeably cut-and-paste repeated. It's a really tiny nitpick, but I didn't even really notice it until earlier this week.\n\nOh, and in case you didn't know, this song was originally [[Prospit Dreamers]]. Why did I change my mind on it? Well, I couldn't figure out how to fit in [[Doctor]] (and by extension [[Penumbra Phantasm]]) and [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] into such a happy sounding song. It just wasn't really working for me, nor was the time signature.\n\nBut I definitely felt like the song was a great closer to this half of the album, and Shelby's art for the piece fit perfectly.\n\n<i>Shelby Cragg:</i> ([Tumblr](https://whaoanon-old.tumblr.com/post/9269298819))\n\nYay, I finally get to post the art that I did for Solatrus’s awesome solo album, Prospit & Derse! Solatrus is a cool dude and you should all go buy the album RIGHT NOW!!\n\nThis is on the track Center of Brilliance!\n\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nThere are two \"HQ\" versions of this track's artwork. The one used as the main cover art is the version posted on Tumblr, which is 998x998 (appears to be source resolution), but has some JPEG artefacting. Below is the 700x700 artwork used on Bandcamp, which is a clean PNG, but blurs some details (due to downscaling).\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/center-of-brilliance-bandcamp.png\" width=\"300\">"

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nThis was definitely the song that started everything off. It's dark, dreary, but still majestic like the very moon it describes. The music takes on you a flight. You're one of the Derse Dreamers, the wind rushing across your face as you approach the moon's surface. Carapaces scurrying about, too afraid to be caught after curfew, wary of Jack Noir and his gang.\n\nMy original goal was to make this song set the example of how I perceive Derse. Dark, but not evil. Fitting for the Dreamers we know and love there.\n\nI definitely tried to go into some new territory with this song. While I've always loved the Metroid Prime Trilogy soundtrack, this was my first real attempt at trying to imitate many quality's of that trilogy's music.\n\nThe violin that comes in pretty early on was actually added in near the end of the album's production, and the idea to really strongly associate every song with the kids didn't occur to me until part of the way into doing Prospit's half, but I'll get to that later.\n\nI really have to say I like the the bass I chose for this song. It has a sort of heart beat quality to it. Very simple, very deep. But it really cuts through. Of course, I did get to do my favorite high pass/bitcrushed beats again, but this time I did a spin on it: Gross Beat. I mentioned it with [[Crystalanthology]], but I used Gross Beat far more extensively in Derse.\n\nWhen I was initially creating this song, Prospit & Derse was a concept album. You, the listener, would have been guided along a journey, first to Derse, going through the Darkened Streets, up [[The Obsidian Towers|the Obsidian Towers]] to where the [[Derse Dreamers]] were jamming out, before heading deep into the [[Core of Darkness]], until you were suddenly transported to Prospit, appearing in the [[Hallowed Halls]] before repeating the journey with Prospit's counterparts. Honestly, if you listen to the album as Derse & Prospit instead, you still can kind of get that vibe!\n\nYou can definitely hear the idea of that in how it goes into The Obsidian Towers, but I ended up removing the more seemless transitions in favor of just having two somewhat parallel albums, and stuck with the parallel idea for awhile. This is the most obvious in the first two songs of each half. Hallowed Halls is based on Darkened Streets, and [[The Golden Towers]] is based on The Obsidian Towers.\n\nIn a side note, I'd love to link you to the artist who did the song cover art for Darkened Streets, but I've lost contact with them! If anyone knows where I can get in contact again, please let me know!"

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nI started to shift styles for this one a bit. I wanted something that was more majestic sounding, but still as dark as Darkened Streets. Ultimately, I decided to feature the choir section more in the intro. It actually was probably the first synth I put in this song. Everything basically followed.\n\nI had a bit more fun with the bassline in this song, though it's not particularly complex. The focus definitely on the time shifting beats, a la Dave. Hell, Dave is the main reason I decided to use Gross Beat heavily. I wonder if Dave feels like a Time Lord as the Knight of Time?\n\nThe Obsidian Towers was actually one of the last songs I finished composing for the album, because I got totally stuck on it without having the string section in there.\n\nAnyway, I think this song definitely describes the Towers well enough, though, I feel like I could have gone for something a bit more powerful in sound. Something more looming, more... ominous. Oh well. Hindsight is 20/20, yeah? To be fair, [[The Golden Towers]] suffers from this issue as well, so it was probably also a composition problem. Woosp!\n\nNonetheless, the string section in this song, especially right at the end, is one of the cooler sounding harmonies I've thrown together.\n\nI really have always loved the architecture Andrew picked for the moons, though personally I feel it fits Derse far better than Prospit."

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (original commentary)\n\nWell, this is the most popular song from Prospit & Derse. Not surprised it eventually would show up. :&gt;\n\nThis song, along with [[Core of Darkness]], captures the very core idea I had in mind for the Prospit & Derse album: writing music about the settings, but showing that the mere existence of the kids on those moons influences the music as well.\n\nDerse Dreamers was the first to actually reach that goal, and was actually the first song to be fully completed on the entire album.\n\nOf course, this song being retroactively tossed into the [[flash:1720|Shut Up and Jam]] page helped with its popularity quite a bit.\n\nRetroactively gaining an additional featured song... from a page that existed before my first real feature. How's that for weird time shit?\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nThe fan favorite. Without a freaking doubt. This one compares to [[track:frost-vol6]] in popularity, and I'm willing to bet is probably even more popular thanks to horizon's [vocal cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9SQjvPLAWs).\n\nWhat's that? You hear Iron Man in it? Yeah, so do I. Oops. That string section is kind of hilariously similar. It's a huge coincidence, though, because I really don't listen to Black Sabbath whatsoever.\n\nWhen I started this song, I knew I wanted two things: Rose playing violin, and Dave being a bad-ass with time-shifted beats. I ended up making the opening motif and let it repeat for most of the song. People seemed to really like the strong focus on Rose and Dave, but I think even more so people enjoyed the callbacks to their respective Medium world themes ([[Endless Climb]] and [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]], respectively).\n\nThough, maybe it was the name? Maybe it was the amazing art Mixt did? Speaking of, here's what she had to say:\n\n<i>Mixt:</i>\n\nI recall the idea was to draw Rose and Dave jamming on Derse, but the piece itself made me think of space, so they ended up jamming in the space between Derse and its moon instead. Rose's bowhand unfortunately reflects my own terrible grip when playing violin.\n\nAlso, I laughed when it was discovered that Derse Dreamers made it into [[flash:1720|[S] Rose and Dave: Shut up and jam]] just prior to the album's release. Fandom, you never cease to amaze me.\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i>\n\nI agree with her there. I was very amused when people noticed the change to that page even before I had the chance to mention it to anyone. Crazy fandom ninjas!\n\nYeah, that's pretty much all there is to this song. It was remarkably straightforward. I didn't do anything particularly surprising for myself on this one. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, and I did it.\n\nMore importantly, however, I'm thrilled this song is enjoyed by so many people, and I've been blown away how people have have been using this song in their own derivative works. It's just really heartwarming as an artist to see my work out there having a life of its own."

Period.\n\nThis was the song that made me realize my production had legitimately hit a professional level and wasn't ever going to go back.\n\nThis was the only Derse song that was written in response to a Prospit song. I wrote [[Center of Brilliance]] before Core of Darkness, and I really wanted to try to counter the very.. bright and circular (I guess?) feel I had with CoB.\n\nOut of all of my production work, Core of Darkness has the most movie soundtrack sound to it, and that's pretty awesome. Fantastic way to close out the album.\n\nIt's also a nice precursor to my current interest in trip hop music.\n\n<i>Shad Andrews:</i> ([Tumblr](https://whaoanon-old.tumblr.com/post/9269099953), excerpt)\n\nNow I can post this!!\n\nAgain, I’ve been able to do some album art for MSPA, and it’s been another great experience!\n\nPlease go and check out the album, and please buy it if you can. He worked really hard, and imho the music is REALLY great.\n\nmwah\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i> (one year anniversary)\n\nMy favorite. While you all have a soft spot for [[Derse Dreamers]], I have one for Core of Darkness. This is the song that made me actually say out loud, \"Whoa, when did my music start sounding professional?\"\n\nYeah. This one. I had more fun working on this song than any other song on this album. And it still stands out to me as being one of, if not, my best electronic/downbeat songs. I wasn't really sure what I was going with when I picked the name Core of Darkness. This song doesn't particularly have a \"round\" feel to it, amusingly. But I wanted to just grasp the raw essence, the core, if you will, of what Derse is, and continue with the idea that the kids influence the way the music sounds on the moons just as they affect many of the characters in the game through prototyping.\n\nI'm very pleased with the string sections I did, though it's not really a complex melody. Lots of repetition, just like the rest of this half of the album. But the atmosphere is pretty damn awesome, and without a doubt set the tone for some of my future works. I wasn't aware that I actually really liked trip-hop at the time, but Nick introduced me to the genre, and it completely clarified why I enjoyed doing this half of the album so much.\n\nI'm also very impressed with the art that Shad did, though it wasn't exactly what I had in mind. However, I preferred to let the artists have some free reign, so this actually turned out better than what I was thinking! Here's what she had to say on her piece and the rest of the album:\n\n<i>Shad Andrews:</i>\n\nWhen I was first asked about doing album art, it was really, really exciting!! Those who know me, know that I'm all about the carapace and everything in general, and having an album based on the kingdoms was really exciting and it was an honor to be confronted about it at all!\n\nI've always dreamed to do things for Homestuck, just because of how it has affected me. I'm always up to doing things, and it's always great when I'm allowed, and when it's something that I feel passionate about.\n\nI did the album art to Core of Darkness, which honestly is one of my favorite songs and I can't tell if I'm being biased or not because it's my art.\n\nI took the chance to do something new, and I wanted to go above and beyond what quality work that I normally do. I wanted this to be something I could be proud of, and something that would showcase just how good I thought it was!\n\nSolatrus sent me a sample of the unfinished song, which I listened to on repeat the whole time I was working. I ended up doing the whole thing in one sitting, and I just worked on it all night long because I was just. really into it. I wanted to do something really extreme and fun to look at. The angle being. like.. you were in the core, a la the title of the music.\n\nI can't tell you how many times I wanted to just give up and scrap it, because it was hard and something I hadn't done - the perspective, along with the lineless-like style.\n\nBut I'm really happy with it even a year later.\n\nThe music itself was just. really really great. I loved it not just because I worked on it, which was a great plus, but all the art, all of it, was really great. The music was awesome, and I loved the whole thing behind it. Using the kids' instruments and styles to create the music for each kingdom. And just??? It seemed really fitting, what with how much I like the carapace and all.\n\nIt was really an honor to work on it, and I still listen to the album every now and again, even a year later. I'm really proud of everyone who worked on it and thankful for the album and the art.\n\n<i>Solatrus:</i>\n\nAw, thanks Shad! I really appreciate that you enjoy the album so much."

If you don't know what happened, up until half-way through Act 4 a guy called [[artist:bill-bolin|Bill Bolin]] was on the time, one of the original members. He was a great musician, that much can't be denied; he wrote a lot of tracks that appeared in early act 3; [[track:guardian|Jade's bass solo]], [[track:guardian-v2|the remix of it]], [[track:contention-vol4|the last part of the Dave and Bro battle]]... some others I forget. During [[flash:1720|that flash]] with Dave and Rose on Derse the original music was five Bolin tracks, ones he wasn't all that happy with. He flipped out and did a lot of things that ended up with him dropped from the team, and his music replaced.\n\nI called replacing Jade's bass solo (I was enthusiastic about getting something of mine into the comic). We figured there'd probably be an existing piece of music used for the remix on Prospit so there were a couple of different versions remixing different tracks until [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Something Really Excellent]] was locked in.\n\nWe were on a strict timetable at the time, so I didn't get the chance to find a really good bass voice or find a good rhythm. That was much improved for the actual release in Volumes 1-4."

              "Commentary": "<i>Buzinkai:</i> (['Doctor' Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsG71P_zEIE))\n*Partial transcript:*\nHello internet, my name is George Buzinkai. I am one of the musicians, well, I was one of the musicians for Ms Paint Adventures. I wrote such songs as [[Endless Climb]], [[Showtime (Imp Strife Mix)|Imp Strife Mix? Strife Imp Mix]] I think and of course the wildly remixed Doctor, which I have open in the original software I wrote it in.\nI'm about to show you a few things you didn't know about the song Doctor, and I'm going to show you a few things people get wrong when remixing it. I don't find a problem with it because half the time I don't even notice it but sometimes there are some things. I think some people have listened to the song by ear and have attempted to write a remix using that and I get requests a lot to post a MIDI of this. Due to the fact I wrote it in PxTone that's really hard to do. There is also another reason, the song was built in such a way that it's really hard to give certain things from the song and I'll explain that as we go.\nFirst things first all of the instruments except for the main three main three notes of the main chords which you know were written with instruments from the original [[artist:cave-story|Cave Story]]. If you listen to the drum track that's the original Cave Story drum soundtracks. All the other instruments are also from Cave Story. When I was originally writing the song I always wrote top down so believe it or not the first thing I wrote was the bassline. Then as I was going I added the drums, and from there I decided I should add an extra bassline. Once I added the extra bassline I decided it would be a good time to write an actual, you know, melody line. I was originally planning on using strings but I accidentally put in square waves and I fell in love with it right after I did it and I'm like \"I can't switch this to strings now so I'm just gonna leave it as it is.\"\nNow the rectangle waves [Note: Referring to the main melody of the song.] I'm focusing on right now are written in a really weird way, not one that I would normally use for writing on a piano or something like that. I wrote the top note first and I wrote the other notes just to harmonize with it. From there I wrote the second note. I obviously didn't write the third one yet, I just wanted to make sure it sounded right. From there I wrote the third note which was kind of a crapshoot but you know, why not. Now, the weird part was once I got to the part where it starts the arpeggiation I already had the instruments here but the problem was I had them on different stereo channels. Like this one was on the left speaker this one was on the right speaker and this one's in the center.\nHowever, the problem was once I got to the arpeggiation I really didn't want to have one track doing the arpeggiation and have to switch each note on the pan menu here. I really didn't want to do that so I was lazy and put each note on a different instrument to make the panning effect so if you play just with the top note this is what it sounds like. Believe it or not I didn't write this first and then write the second one and then write the third one under that because that would've been insane and I think that probably would've made me look a lot better than I actually am. So what I did was I wrote the actual whole thing on the one track on the top and then moved each note manually by having the top one highlighted with all the notes and then just moving it and erasing it from the top.\nAlso, this is the part of the song [Note: Referring to the melody that starts at 0:27,] that is most often screwed up in remixes and I don't have a problem with that, this is really hard. This is not an easy thing. I've tried. I can play the whole beginning of the song on piano. I can't play this part at all. It's insane, and the reason for this is the notes go all over the place. The reason for that is because I would take a regular chord and then I would put the notes maybe down an octave or just find another note that would fit. I wanted to stretch this chord out as far as I could and still make it fit to the key, which is kind of what made it so weird in the beginning and actually if you look about where my mouse is you can see that this was just one line that just went down. So, since we have you here, I can actually slow this down for you so you can hear what it sounds like slowly.\nI don't expect anyone to play that at full speed. I've actually seen someone play about the right thing at full speed and that still freaking amazes me. I wouldn't expect that kind of thing. I thought that was unplayable. Also, this may seem lazy now, but it's probably lazy then too, but I copy and pasted this whole section and then added an extra melody line to make it interesting.\nNow here's a secret, why this song is called Doctor, and what this song is based on. Believe it or not this song is actually based on [[track:moonsong|Moonsong]] and Mischievous Robot from [[artist:cave-story|Cave Story]]. I wrote this song right shortly after Super Smash Brothers Brawl came out for the Wii. I know because I was playing that while I wrote it. There is a constant tone much like in Mischievous Robot that plays in the background and it's actually supposed to be a heartbeat monitor. This actually just stays constant the entire time (tone changes) except for when it changes right there (tone changes again) yeah it shows you how much I know about my own music (tone switches to alternating between two different tones.) But I try to keep that a constant side beat in the back there.\nWe're here to talk about music so if you want to see any more of my music in this fashion, perhaps with a little more in-depth viewer, if you think there's something I missed or something that you're curious about with the music please let me know. I'm actually really open to talking about it, I think it's kind of cool that it went this far. I'm still actually listening to all the freaking remixes of this song that are online right now. You have to understand that I'm completely blown away."

It is not quite as mega a mega-album size-wise as, say, [[album:homestuck-vol-5|Vol. 5]], but it's still pretty damn mega if you ask me. Extra special props to my homeboy [[artist:toby-fox|Toby \"Radiation\" Fox]] for mastering this bad boy and helping put it all together.\n\n*(Continued in [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]]!)*\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20111029075142/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/))\n\n<b>EOA5</b>\n\nIt was quite an adventure getting that file hosted, but I believe it should be stable now. Thanks very much to Tom of Newgrounds for helping out with this!\n\nAlso thanks to all the contributing artists and musicians for doing a great job.

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\n\"Calamity\" was inspired by the very same update that inspired the Pantskat craze - [the image of Gamzee returning, Warhammer of Zillyhoo in hand](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3847) is translated into two sonic elements, ie honks and chanting. What I've enjoyed really intensely about [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew's]] sense of humor in Homestuck and his other adventures is his gradual elevation of silly details onto the pedestals of utter drama, and with this track I tried to recreate that. You laughed at the honks and the chanting before - now your heart races (at least I hope).\n\nThere was a certain difficulty in making \"Calamity\" really work for me. I had a couple of different sounds I was attempting all at once, each working on their own but sort of fighting for control when mashed together. The introduction and conclusion of the song using a theme from [[track:walk-stab-walk-r-and-e|\"Walk-Stab-Walk\"]] needed to be really punchy, while I really needed the middle of the song to glide, and the connecting bits with the chanting needed to build and build in tension. There are a lot of different sounds in the song's palette, the most difficult of which to utilize was the enormous saw synth that dominates the middle. Getting that thing to be grand without utterly overpowering the rest of the song was incredibly difficult.\n\nOverall I was really satisfied with how much excitement there is in this song. It's got a big simple melody but it doesn't outstay its welcome. As the album opener, it sets up the stakes and excitement of Homestuck without sort of beating the point into you by lasting too long. I think of it as a cousin to [[track:sburban-jungle|\"Sburban Jungle\"]] or at least another song approached in that dramatic, electronic way.\n\nThe countdown sample is from a NASA recording, I believe it's the launch of Apollo 11.\n\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://seeyoutmorra.tumblr.com/post/12054861967/homestuck-volume-8-track-art), excerpt)\n\nI had a lot of fun working on Calamity which gave me an opportunity to adapt a very classic Marvel comic book style to Homestuck. My favorite part of the piece is the small touch in Karkat’s eyes where the background shows through, coloring them. As [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|Bowman]] worked on Calamity I was developing the composition for the art. [[flash:4085|The moment when Karkat and Gamzee lunge at each other]] got my heart racing in the sheer epic-ness of the sight. It had to be the track art."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i> (composer, original commentary)\n\nAlas poor Vriska. This scene stood out quite a bit from the Scrapbook Near-end-of-act Scratch-a-thon as being yet more humility to Vriska as a character - first hinted at during John's talk with her around the whole 'lifdoff' time (which is also why most of the song is taken from [[track:lifdoff|lifdoff]].)\n\nThe idea was to create something vaguely romantic and a bit tragic for the whole 'd8' thing. I used lifdoff as a starting point because that's become my sort of unofficial 'John' theme - It's quite light and goofy but reasonably heroic and fantastical. [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] shows up at around 2:17, shortly followed by a slightly modified lift from [[track:death-of-the-lusii|Death of the Lusii]] (as mentioned previously in this topic). After that it slides into an additionally modified version of [[track:ruins|Ruins]]/[[track:awakening|Awakening]] for reasons that are hopefully obvious and also because I like that tune\n\nThe main reason I made this is because Vriska's had a but few moments when she wasn't terrorizing everybody and generally acting the huge bitch. Add to this the whole 'fat vriska' thing, and the very bombastic music she's had thus far... It was nice to give her last bit of humility a soundtrack.\n\nAnd the reason [[track:spiders-claw|Vriska's actual theme]] doesn't show up anywhere is because I find it difficult to work with as it's kinda crazy  /excuse.\n\nIt took me about half a day to get the tambourines sounding decent and they still don't sound like what I imagined they would...\n\nAlso I was trying to channel some of the style from the music of the Little Big Adventure games. The soundtrack for thems' awesome and ya'll should go listen to it!\n\n<i>Malcolm Brown:</i> (composer, tumblr version)\n\n\"DYRM\" was essentially cre8ed as a sort of 8acking track to the John and Vriska 'date' sequence (around about here). The idea was to do a sort of schlocky romantic 8allad that combined elements of Johns goofiness but with the tragedy that hey - Vriska's dead.  Over the course of it, we travel through John and Vriska's memories,  and she's trying to get him to remem8er something important, so there's that element too.  It's kinda sad, 8ut in a way it's also a 8it of a cele8ration of Vriska - She's surprisingly polarizing with a lot of the fan8ase, as the 8est characters often are... :p\n\n<b>THE NAME</b>\n\nI can't immedi8ly recall if the phrase \"Do You Remem8er Me?\" is said by Vriska........ [I think it was](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3924), 8ut it's a faff trying to navigate around that 8it of the comic (I often like na88ing song titles out of the dialogue itself - That's where [[track:at-the-price-of-oblivion|At The Price Of O8livion]] [came from](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3630) and [of course](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4852) [[track:pumpkin-party-in-sea-hitlers-water-apocalypse|Sea Hitler's Water Apocalypse]]. If not, well it felt like as good a title as any. :p The '8' helps immediately recognise the subject matter.\n\n<b>THE TRACK</b>\n\nIt's primarily [[track:lifdoff|\"lifdoff\"]], which I started using a sort of personal theme of John. Other slight inspirations for this track are [\"Anthem Part 2\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-EHT3N5sOI) from The Truman Show and a little 8it of the music of Little 8ig Adventure (primarily the use of woodwinds/percussion).\n\nIt starts off with a simple lightened lifdoff, which carries it for a while.  The percussion at 1:09 was fun to sequence - It's mostly just a collection of taiko samples from the EWQL play library that are quite fun to work with, particularly some the articulation (The 'roll' you hear is one of 'em). What I think works quite well is the power of the Taikos with the lightness of the woodwinds - Gives it quite an emotional punch.\n\n1:33 is almost directly L8A inspired (The layering of the woodwind melody on 8rass I'm sure I got from there).  At this point we're 8uilding up to play the [[track:death-of-the-lusii|'Death of the Lusii]]/[[track:awakening|Awakening']] 8it with a sort of alternate chord progression, but we sneak in a [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] reference around 2:16.\n\n2:26 is meant to directly correlated to These Two panels and is a reference to this track.\n\nThen it 8uilds up to the main section of Awakening at around 3:30.  Given that the main theme is a sort of dreamlike afterlife, it felt appropri8 ::::p\n\nAnd we end! Uncertain cadences all round!\n\nOverall there's quite a 8it I like about this one. The Percussion doesn't vary much, which lets it down I think (It's 8asically just the same loop for most of the song, something I'm hilariously guilty of in most everything I make :p) but it did the jo8 in giving Vriska a good sendoff.\n\nOh yeah - The reason it doesn't use any of [[track:vriskas-theme|Vriska's theme]] is because I find that theme a 8it........ All over the place ::::p Don't get me wrong, it's a cool 8it of music, 8ut I don't find it as easy to play a8out with than other tracks.  8lame my laziness!\n\nI also fully suspect I missed some '8's somewhere........ This stuff's harder than it looks.  God help me if I try to commentary another gorram Terezi track ::::p"

What started off as me meandering about with slightly odd chord progressions became a rather meandering piece in general.  Originally labeled Nether, at least as the piece began to formulate, the first part quickly developed in what I hoped would be a style reminiscent of Russell Brower’s music for Outland in World of Warcraft, primarily the [Outland Suite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8rcQrqOjaM) and [Netherstorm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzCLPD9iouE) (what the first name referenced).  I completed most of the piece without drums or effects at first, but felt something was missing.  After messing around with some different bits of drum samples, I found beats that were suitable for what I was going for, and those helped give more definition to the meter of the piece as much of it was long chords that made it hard to distinguish at times, then added some occasional filter effects to increase the overall spacey feel.  After everything was in place, I listened through it multiple times and just began to imagine [Karkat’s monologue](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4003) about how everything was his fault and the phrase “Galactic Cancer” stuck."

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nThe [[album:squiddles|Squiddles!]] album gets no love. There, I said it. I've mentioned before how awesome it is and how dramatically it has undersold compared to the rest of our material, but apparently everyone is too terrified of its My Little Pony meets Cthulu approach to give it a shot. Trust me, you'll like it more than you think you will.\n\nAnyway, one of the most surprising tracks on that particular album is [[track:ocean-stars|\"Ocean Stars\"]], a peaceful, mysterious little ditty imagined by [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark]] with a nautical theme in mind. I thought it had a beautiful little structure, and I guess the song must have stuck with me because at some point I found myself playing its chords over and over on my keyboard faster and faster until I was sure it would make for a great little indie rock inspired track. So I did just that.\n\nThis song takes its cues most heavily from [\"Regatta de Blanc\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN-nXWHkVpA) by the Police and [[track:life-in-technicolor|\"Life in Technicolor\"]] by Coldplay - the meditatively simple rock backup is accompanied by a huge chorus of wordless vocals provided by countless overdubs of [[artist:tavia-morra|Tavia]] and myself. These middle voices are bookended by the twinkling bell sounds in the high range and the rumbling drums and guitar in the low range to make for a very full mix that really surprised me with its depth. I threw in some slowed-down bubble sounds (the same samples from [[track:mister-bowman-tells-you-about-the-squiddles|\"Mister Bowman Tells You About the Squiddles\"]]) to create the ocean ambiance, something I'd really gotten the chance to hear on a scuba dive I'd done over the summer.\n\nThis is another example of a song that has the \"just right\" feeling about its length. I could probably have easily repeated the vocals endlessly as though I was attempting to induce transcendental meditation - it would probably have had the same effect as [\"Hey Jude\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MjCqQoLLA) or any number of other great songs. Owing though to my sense that this album was going to be a long one (my contributions alone come out to more than 20 minutes of music) I decided to capitalize on having achieved the harmony and just let it end when its thought was fully expressed, not unlike the original composition by Mark."

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nBefore going into a description of this track, I must make a long-overdue rebuttal to the factors that overshadowed its reception. Yes, I know this song and its track art pertain to the Wayward Vagabond. Yes, I know it's sad that Andrew [[flash:4109|\"killed off\"]] the Wayward Vagabond on the same day that this album was released. No, I had no idea that would happen nor do I care how incongruous the song's mood seems in relation to that particular plot point.\n\nAnyway, now that I finally said my keep on that, \"Escape Pod\" was a really really fun track to do. It's a rock track with a feelgood video game attitude - I've heard it described as Sonic music a lot, though to be fair my main reference were Nintendo games, particularly Earthbound from which I borrowed the deliberately fake brass. It also shares some similarities with the Mario sound, kind of really owing to the competitive games such as Mario Kart and Mario Party.\n\nThe track also pulls a lot from actual rock music - the Roxy Music track [\"Street Life\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_dTFdRAvN0) was a big cue here, and the start-stop structure on the second chorus was really inspired by Tally Hall's track [\"Greener\"](https://youtu.be/8sV1EOJQTEI) of which the effect can only be described in exotic dance. I really wanted to pull out the stops on this one and make it catchy as hell, but apparently the [[track:ocean-stars-falling|two]] [[track:davesprite|tracks]] book-ending it on Volume 8 steal its thunder.\n\nWhat more can be said about it? This is about as totally poppy (or perhaps J-poppy) as I get. Compared to stuff like [[track:greenhouse|\"Greenhouse\"]] and [[track:squiddle-samba|\"Squiddle Samba\"]] this track is right up my alley. It in contrast with some of the other stuff that I've made appearing on the very same album (the minimalist piece [[track:gust-of-heir|\"Gust of Heir\"]] which I collaborated on with [[artist:james-dever|James Dever]] comes to mind) you'll see that I can go just as far in the saccharine direction as I can into the abstract. For me range has always been an asset I've felt was important to nurture, so with Volume 8 I set the pace for my work ethic on [[album:ithaca|Ithaca]] in terms of never settling to have \"found my sound\" no matter how well any one idea works."

That's like two girls showing up the party in the same dress. Awkward! Good thing for Jit and I that, like the two girls in that famous scenario, we each have our own swagga and wear those dresses like the hot young messes we are. Wow, don't quote me on that. (Too late - DPF)\n\nAnyway, while [[track:frog-forager|\"Frog Forager\"]] is almost immediate in its \"aw man, yeah, it's THIS kind of tune\" factor for avid listeners of Homestuck music, my ditty \"Frog Hunt\" seems to hit a lot of people out of left field. Maybe it's because I was busy surprising myself with this one as well.\n\nI've mentioned Weather Report a few times as an influence, and while I can't bring even a fraction of that band's musicianship to my work, I really attempted to bring their sense of atmosphere to the piece. There's a lot of elements thrown in there - the wacky time signature (17/8 if I recall correctly), the meandering syncopated piano, the funk breaks, all that latin percussion, plus a pile of odd sound effects. I threw in some frog ambiance using some really odd synthesizers and a toy accordion as well.\n\nThe point of this song was to kind of put the action, the drama, and all that teenage chemistry on hold so I could focus on a moment in the story that might be just a little bit more peaceful. Going on a safari for frogs on a newly-awakened alien forest world seems to beckon a very different angle than the heated stakes typically associated with Homestuck. Plus, I've always felt that the environment of Homestuck deserves a little more attention given that nearly 99% of all art generated by the fans are homages to their favorite characters and not the fantastic places imagined by [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]].\n\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i> (track arist, [Tumblr](https://seeyoutmorra.tumblr.com/post/12054861967/homestuck-volume-8-track-art), excerpt)\n\nFrog Hunt was, like [[Calamity]], one of the more challenging pieces since I opted for a much cleaner (And much more Disney) look for the piece. I totally saw Jade and Dave on the frog hunt, dressing for the part as adventurers and explorers. Jade, in her excitement, may have dragged Dave through a couple of bushes and thorned plants."

              "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120818182915/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/), excerpt)\n\n<b>END OF PAUSE ONE.</b>\n\nI was counting [[flash:5238|\"[S] Dirk: Synchronize.\"]] and [[flash:5252|\"[S] Dirk: Unite.\"]] as one animation, that just happened to be chopped into two parts. Next one is [[flash:5261|EOA6.3]], at the end of Pause 2. Song: Unite Synchronization (Sometimes I name animations after songs. [[flash:1940|Descend]], [[flash:4109|Cascade]]...) By [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm Brown]]. We have entered the Brown Zone. You have been warned.\n\n<i>Malcolm Brown:</i> (composer, original commentary)\n\nThis was an idea borne of two things. Firstly the Dave & Jade vs Noir battle in the banner (Original title was 'Redshift'), and secondly a post-scratch Dave trying to regroup with all the kids (hence - 'Unite' - keeping to the kind of single-world direction thing HS has going for it i.e. Descend, Ascend, Cascade, etc).\n\nThe main premise was to have quite a hefty beat (Dave), bass - including a slap bass solo (Jade), piano (John) and violin (Rose). The premise being as the song continues each part contributes until the end, where all 4 play in sync (hence... er... 'Synchronization').\n\nThere's the tiniest influence from [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] (again). It was also my first attempt at some vague chiptuniness in a while, which may or may not have worked... You decide!\n\nThe breakbeat drum thing was also fun to do.\n\n<i>Malcolm Brown:</i> (commentary redux)\n\nThe idea behind this guy was something similar to the traditional idea of some HS songs being about movement ([[track:descend|\"Descend\"]], [[flash:1668|\"Ascend\"]], [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|\"Upward Movement\"]]), so in this case it's 4 things moving, together as one.  It was becoming reasonably clear that post-scratch, we'd be separating The beta kids up a bit, and ideally, once the dust settled, they would all meet up again - This track's effectively the kids overcoming whatever barriers in their way to unite.\n\nThat was the original idea, anyway.\n\nIt was primarily Dave centered, because in my personal interpretation of Dave I've always seen him as a bit of Roadie - always working behind the scenes to help people out in a lateral manner - as opposed to facing shit head on.  He's also (and again this is personal interpretation) occasionally presented as the least capable of the 4.  Part of it presumably stems from the contrast between Bro, who is so frighteningly capable it hurts, and living in that shadow while trying to emulate him but not quite reaching it is quite a defining trait of Dave.\n\nThat's not to say he's useless, I mean he's died less than John, and he's also not afraid to think laterally about problems and cheat (\"Shenanigans\"), but there's been a few bits where you get the feeling he wishes he was a bit more of the hero his kin are.\n\nUnite Synchronization is essentially a chance for a Strider to shine, to get the band back together and to prepare an ass kicking.\n\nDetails time!\n\n<b>The Track:</b>\n\nWe start with a moment of contemplation, or at least an establishing shot of somewhere.  Then bam - We're moving.  The main hook of this piece is the C - G# - D# - G# pattern, which is probably primarily influenced from Sonata Arctica's [\"The Cage\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPGv2dbBmeY) (Though The Cage is a different key and pattern, but the progression is similar and just has a really nice epic feel).\n\nAt 0:29 we get the main theme of US played on piano - We're representing John here.  Throughout the song I pull in the associated kids instruments but make sure to constantly have the drums going - As if Dave's grabbing each one individually and playing alongside them.  The bass is supposed to be in a constant \"running\" kind of theme throughout the track. An unbelievably cliched dance-y snare drum fill leads us out into the beginning of the middle section.\n\nThe guitar's actually the same guitar sample I used in just about everything these days, but gated - I haven't done any gating for yonks and figured for the sort of dance-y nature of the track it's probably not a bad choice.\n\nAt 1:09, we get the alternate-Showtime (The first few notes are the main melody of [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]]), then at 1:24 we're back into US main melody.  This is all done of Violin, which is of course Rose's signature instrument. I also like the harmony on this one...\n\n1:40's where I try my hand at some breakbeats.  These are actually quite difficult, and since the original slicing sounded a bit odd I also overlap a standard drum loop on top of it - The result is a ridiculous amount of percussion for a solo and a bit of funky panning for good measure.\n\nThe break is essential. Even Striders' needs to pause for breath.\n\nWith the bass coming in we're in Jade territory at 1:56.  The bass solo here is kinda pulled out of anywhere, but has a kind of Sonic-the-Hedgehog feel to it.\n\n2:20 we bring the percussion back in (A bar late, I love the delay there) and the violin's brought more harmony with it.  Now here the sensible thing to do to keep up the original metaphor is to have the Piano, Slap Bass AND violin playing (Geddit? At this point all the Kids are together and rocking out) but for some reason I went with a bunch of other voices.  I guess there's still bass.... And the choir could maybe be John singing along? I'm not sure... Potentially missed a good opportunity there... But I'm still happy with it.\n\nAnd that's US in a nutshell!\n\n<b>The Flash:</b>\n\nSo despite it not being the exact context original thought of, the 2-part Flash actually manages to fit the original theme albeit with different kids.  Plus it's Strider centric, so that's another plus, and once again I get to dramatically cut to silence while someone dies :D\n\nBut then everyone's alive by the end of it, so that's got to be a record turnaround!\n\nIt is remarkably disturbing how seriously on the ball Dirk is.  Not only does he paradox up his own reincarnation with a bucket and his own head, he manages to resurrect two ladies and get them and himself time-warped to Jake.\n\nThis after his little presentation on Derse with Hearts' head.\n\nI'd like to see Dave match that. :p"

              "Commentary": "<i>Hilary Troiano:</i> (composer, [Tumblr](https://jaydeis.tumblr.com/post/19609363685/someone-sent-me-a-pm-asking-for-some-commentary))\n\nSomeone sent me a PM asking for some commentary about my two MSPA songs, so here it is.\n\n<i>Hilary Troiano:</i> ([[media:misc/hilary-troiano-commentary.mp3|audio commentary transcript]])\n\n<i>(Before talking about this song, Hilary talks about her other song, [[track:ace-of-trump]], with those sections transcribed on that song's page.)</i>\n\nUm, my other song, Homefree. This one's got less to it, like [laughter] my first goal of this song was actually for me to learn how-how to use a program called Fruity Loops Studio, um... 'cuz, up until this point all of my music had been done with a program called Melody Assistant, and in some ways I really love Melody Assistant like, I have this whole sound database to it that makes it really have an incredibly authentic sound to the instruments but, on the other side of the spectrum it has very little synth options, which, whi-which is really the direction that the MS Paint Adventures music team has moved in, um. So I was like alright alright, let's learn how to synth a bit. Um, and so, in some ways um, Homefree draws a lot from a song I wrote AGES and ages ago, it was a song called [[track:shooting-star|Shooting Star]] which, I mean i-it was kind of basically supposed to sound like an anime opening and it did but i-it... it was missing something. Like, it was very mor— it was more of in a minor key and it was slower, and so I was like, alright. Well first things first I'm gonna try and get this up to, what was it the tempo of [incomprehensible] I don't know how you say that. It's an opening of an anime that you may or may not have heard that just is really high energy and I was like 'Okay, so, if I wanna have a high energy song I probably should try and make it sound about this fast' [laughter].\n\nSo, the opening of Homefree is basically the opening of Shooting Star and, then, then I started like, I was like you know, after you get past the opening it's not really good until you get to the ending and so I was like 'What else can I put in here?' and so I started putting down the [[track:homestuck-anthem|Homestuck theme]] just because it was easy and jumped to mind, and so, when that, when that really seemed to work I was like 'You know what? Let's throw in more bits of different Homestuck songs in there' like, after the um Homestuck theme, what really... what I think most people don't really notice is that the next part actually sounds like, like the like [[Sburban Jungle|Suburban Jungle]] like, it's-it's moved down about one note but it's like, Suburban Jungle is like [singing] and then, and then in Homefree it's [singing] y'know it's basically the same melody.\n\nUm, and then, then it moves into another part which is... kind of hard to hear but there's a little bit of [[Upward Movement (Dave Owns)|Dave Rocks- Rocks at this Game]]? Is that what it's called? Wow I don't even know the songs of the MS Paint Adventures music team, I'm the worst member! [laughter] But anyway, anyway, but you can hear like the [singing] underneath the violin melody and then after that it goes into what was the ending to Shooting Star which is this, um... it-it's um, I think it's one of the strongest parts of the song because it's a... It's basically like, it's supposed to sound like kind of like just like breaking free you know like, like it rises and then at the very end it just, goes off into it's own place um...\n\nOne of the other interesting things about Homefree- waitwaitwait, I need to address something about Homefree [laughter] okay so, I know the MS Paint Adventures music team, we get a lot of people say 'Ohh this sounds like this this sounds like [[artist:touhou-project|Touhou]] this sounds like' I don't know um [laughter] I didn't mean to make this sound like a Pokemon song, I realized after it was already out there that, yeah, that ther-there's a part to it that really does sound like a [[artist:pokemon|Pokemon]] battle theme [laughter] oh god! That wasn't intentional, that really wasn't intentional but um [laughter] I guess that's what happens when you're part of the Pokemon fandom for so long like I mean I w— I was actually a really really obssessed fan for a while like-like I don't know if any of you, if you've been to Bulbagarden, if you've ever used the Bulbapedia or listened to the Bulbacast, yeah I used to be part of all that I used to be like the top editor of Bulbapedia and I used to like just rant about how Brock was the greatest character ever on the Bulbacast [laughter] I don't really do that anymore now and so that's part of the reasons why it's so embarassing that [laughter] my music sounds like Pokemon music [laughter] oh god! Okay okay anyway, um... yeah anyway, so.\n\nOne-one thing that I-that I did wanna make it sound like though and I don't really remember what inspired this but, in the last section I was like 'You know what? Um, since this is- since time is such a big theme in Homestuck, I think I'm gonna try and make it sound like the [[track:westminster-quarters|Westminster bells]] playing here' and-and so you hear those [singing] which actually isn't how the Westminster bells go but y'know what, screw it! That's how I remember them because, I don't actually hear the Westminster bells that often. [laughter] No, that's a lie, I used to hear them all the time in college and I still don't remember exactly how the notes go, um. [laughter]. So, anyway, anyway. Um... but... wait no, I remember now! I remember what led to it! Because I noticed that exactly at 4 minutes and 13 seconds into the song like it-like I was like 'It would sound really good if there was just a bell chiming here and it's-and it's like [singing]' and then I was like, I was like 'You know what? Let's-let's make it sound like this is where the clock strikes twelve and it's like, so earlier there's the Westminster bells which starts, which plays right before... right when the clock strikes mid-midnight or noon or any sort of twelve, and then at 4 minutes and 13 seconds in it starts chiming, um, like that's when the... final countdown ends, whatever you wanna call it, like when the, when the timer runs out and hits zero. Um, and for a bit I actually considered since the-th-it actually only chimes four times, I was thinking of having just eight more chimes of it while nothing else was playing. I... didn't actually go with that though because I thought that would just sound weird and artsy to most people like you know, why didn't the song already end, why can't I go on listening to the next song... but I don't know, anyway. [laughter]\n\nLong story short, um... actually I don't know what is the long story short. Well i-it's basically, um, it's not quite the Homestuck theme. I-i-it's, I do-I don't think it's gonna be used, I don't think Hussie's ever gonna use any of my stuff but, you know I'm, I'm really happy whenever I get anybody saying that they like my work, like, that's really one of the best things about writing music I'm not even gonna lie. I mean, I love doing all kinds of art, I love, I love writing, I love drawing, I'm not really that great at anything except programming [laughter] but, um, one of the things I love most about music um, is, when you're a musician, there's... uhh how do I even explain this... um it's like... a lot of people really love it, but there's so few people who really know-know how to get into it like, they think that you know, you have to be a really blessed singer or, or um... like you need to have just been born playing the saxophone or something and, you need like uh, an agent recognize you- I don't think any of that's really necessary to really, just start writing music and start enjoying it like, I-I-I think people would— it's kind of like any art, it takes, it takes some practice and then all of a sudden you'll start surprising yourself like 'Wow, did I really make that? Is it really possible for someone to make something that sounds like this? Is it possible for me to make something that sounds like this? I don't need help, I can do this on my own?' Um, or maybe that's just how it was for me I mean... I, I... sometimes I still think it's kind of amazing that I can make anything never mind something that, gets-that's part of such a really amazingly talented team such as the MSPA music team...

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nTwo of the tracks I put on Volume 8 were collaborations with other Homestuck musicians, something I've been meaning to do more of because two heads are usually better than one. The first of the two was \"Gust of Heir\", a track that James Dever wrote and for which I did the production.\n\nJames and I are both fans of minimalism, specifically the work of Philip Glass. An eerie-looking autographed program from the Philip on Film tour graces the wall of my room, and the primary piece of music that got me interested in composition is [Einstein on the Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_on_the_Beach), a five-hour opera consisting largely of slowly-evolving repeated figures using chanted numbers and solfege. Those otherwise unfamiliar might know his music better from the many movies he's scored including Secret Window, The Truman Show, and The Hours.\n\nAnyway, I knew right away where James was coming from when he sent me a midi demo of \"Gust of Heir\" though originally it was arranged as a piano solo. Without access to a pro recording situation as on the [[album:sburb|Sburb]] piano suite, we knew there would have to be an alternate solution, hence the electronic approach. I played pretty heavily with a set of new sounds, specifically the soundfonts of Ethan Winer, an audio professional whose work was recommended by [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] a good while back.\n\nAs I have on many occasions I took cues from [Oblique Strategies](http://www.rtqe.net/ObliqueStrategies/) to get some ideas for the arrangement. Part of the intrigue in producing this piece was that it was fully written, meaning that in some ways I was boxed-in to a complete journey for the song to take musically yet in others free to really explore and discover a unique sound for the song. I really played toggling a slew of effects until this tune became rendering hell for my computer. I stepped a bit outside my own range of comfort and got some drum loops from [[artist:clark-powell|Clark Powell]] to really polish off the piece, adding a touch that otherwise would probably have eluded me."

At first I was drilling to [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1BG8NspIOM) [dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTx3G6h2xyA) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfvIE2pVn3w) to get my blood going, [slowed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPQWYrq6LSs) [things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCVJ-uoGOAY) [down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcofrLg1GxI), then moved to some [more traditional music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUGMxkgIGb0). In the process I found [[Even in Death]] made it’s move in to the playlist as the Kodo sound naturally caught my ear. I let [[artist:clark-powell|Plaz]] know this and soon I found him picking my brain for what I listen to when I’m developing a choreography. He sent me versions of Even in Death for my own use. Luckily he decided to stick the new “Belly Mix” version on the latest album.\n\nAs for the art of the piece I decided to dress as [[album:mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido|Hadron Kaleido]] since she was designed to be a dancer. It was the most relatably way to attach belly dancing to Homestuck.\n\nThe art side of it was especially fun. A lot of editing and detail work went in to this. I’m especially fond of the red and violet eyes."

With little conscious attempts at maintaining structure (other than the section after the intro, which appears a few times to hold things together), it can come off as a wild ride through a bunch of interesting ideas just sort of strung together like a glass mobile made with craft glue and shiny twine.  And that is a pretty accurate description.  The piece was sort of an experiment for me, filled with a lot of concepts that might even have needed a separate piece to flesh them out properly, but I made this piece with the Volume 8 submissions deadline looming over head (I think it was a little under a week until final decisions on tracks were supposed to be).  This is also an example of a piece where I set out with a clear mindset for what I wanted.  Seeing there was no piece based on Echidna and Jade’s encounters ([[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] didn’t show us [[track:frostbite|his tracks]] until around when the order was being decided hehe), I wanted something majestic and regal, something befitting of a monstrous queen in ancient stone halls of a frozen world.  Eventually it developed into a sort of audio tour of Echidna’s palace and highlighted the conversation, never fully revealed, that took place between Jade and Echidna as they struck a deal.\n\n<i>Killian Ng:</i> (original artwork crop, as presented [on Bandcamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20160412142102/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/bargaining-with-the-beast))\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/bargaining-with-the-beast-crop.png\" width=\"300\">"

Originally for [[album:the-wanderers|The Wanderers]], because there weren’t any WQ tracks and I liked her portrayal in the comic, I wanted something regal, almost stoic, but also forlorn.  With the beginning, I imagined her away from the others in their camp, sitting alone on some stone at night and listening to an old music box, one of few possessions that she could have salvaged from Prospit.  From there she reminisces, from her perspective, on the progression of the session and her foresight of and departure from the impending devastation of Prospit.  In the end, she closes the trinket, accepts her new fate, and returns to her fellow exiles."

While making this all I could imagine was a bizarre Andrew Hussie Elmer Fudd hunting 'Scwatches'...\n\nMore or less my first attempt to do something in this style. Also, surprisingly, most of it was played live on keyboard into the sequencer (not something I normally do) and then heavily quantized to fix my wonky playing. It gives it a <i>slightly</i> more organic feel, most noticeable on the chords during the [[track:explore|'Explore']] section at the end (Which may also owe a little bit to the Monkey Island soundtrack).\n\nBasically a bit of music for [Andrew's huntin' of Scratch](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4056) shortly before the end of act. Included is the [\"AAAAAHHH FUCKING WOLF!!\"](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4063) moment for good measure (That was added after the first draft to [[artist:toby-fox|Rad's]] suggestion). There was even talk of getting some grumbly vocals from [[artist:andrew-hussie|the man 'imself]], but alas...\n\nHad quite a bit of fun doin' this one.

Soon some big drums and some spacey guitars found their way into the mix (in my attempts to make something on the line of ambient black or doom metal).  Finally, I added Dave’s “blast off” to help Rose with a metal-ified version of [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]] (which people keep requesting a full version of… maybe).  This was another track that I had a clear design for, following as best as I could the events surrounding [Rose and Dave’s chat on Derse](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3875) before creating the Green Sun, focusing more on the atmosphere surrounding the debacle than what they talked about.  After putting the original version up for the team to see, [[artist:clark-powell|Plazmataz]] offered to spruce things up.  And they did.  And it was awesome.  And then [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]] said he could make some crazy drums for the last section.  And he did.  And it was awesome too.  And that was how Virginia was founded!"

I am not sure what to say about it.  I played live guitar and cello on it.  It was one of the first full guitar based things I wrote for MSPA and the first that I used my computer to record rather than a Tascam mixing board + studio that I had used on my very old works.  Its mechanical sound and return to the beginning at its end reminded me of Beat Mesa, and it kind of became my own sort of theme music for The Scratch.  Also it is now the first track written by me to be used in an animation and [[flash:4390|it is amazing]]."

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\n\"Revered Return\" began as a track called [[track:dirgeish|\"Dirgeish\"]], a .pxtone composition that [[artist:nick-smalley|Nick]] had completed some time ago but never managed to squeeze into an album. Because as a chip tune it had been long overlooked, I decided to take a whack at producing it in a different style for inclusion on Volume 8. I had been looking for a piece that would work as a rock tune, and \"Dirgeish\" really struck me because of the heavy involvement of drums, its steady pace, and dynamic structure.\n\nThe unique challenge of arranging \"Revered Return\" was pinning down exactly what was what - \"Dirgeish\" had maximized use of its resources as an electronic composition, shifting instrumentation several times in ways that wouldn't translate to a rock context. I found myself in a very subjective position, kind of picking and choosing what things would stay in and what things would be changed, while overall trying to maintain the original structure of the song.\n\nThe structure I think might be the most unique part of \"Revered Return\" - it doesn't waste time by really repeating itself a lot. Nine out of ten times I work on a song I find myself writing or arranging something that moves in a very basic structure like ABAB or AABA or other variants, etc. \"Dirgeish\" gave me the challenge of establishing coherency in a piece that seemed to move almost completely linearly, and I made sure to preserve its sort of ABCDEFGBA-type structure in arranging \"Revered Return\" for Volume 8.\n\n<i>Nick Smalley:</i> (composer)\n\n[[track:ohgodwhat|Remember that thing about ORGMaker?]] Yeah, this song, too. Except add me asking [[artist:andrew-huo|Andrew Huo]] to help finish it and [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|Bowman]] to ramp it up, and you've got Revered Return. :3"

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nSo, like it or not, [[track:how-do-i-live-bunny-back-in-the-box-version|my signature song]] seems to be the country ballad made famous by a movie about how Nicolas Cage and John Cusack screw up absolutely everything and destroy the Las Vegas strip. Hence, for Volume 8, I decided to do a more serious version of \"How Do I Live\" that doesn't mortify me entirely.\n\nI always had thought of [[track:how-do-i-live|\"How Do I Live\"]] as a breakup song, so as an anthem of dependency between generic 90's lovers I was underwhelmed. However, in Con Air it's meant to be the love theme of a woman whose husband serves in the military, giving the song a very different meaning. The stakes are not whether the singer's lover will stay or leave but whether they will live or die, a thought that is instantly more resonant for anyone who has been in love I think.\n\nThe trick to this one for me was cutting out all the bullshit really - the ridiculous key change is removed and the drums are minimal to the extent of sounding like a funeral march. Rather than starting off with chipper little electric organs and keyboards, this version takes a cue from [\"Purple Rain\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6Y1gohk5-A) and uses only electric guitar and vocals for the first minute. The vocals start off sounding a million miles away and are subtly brought closer and closer until the other instruments join in on the second verse.\n\nI added a new bridge section in so that [[artist:thomas-ferkol|Thomas Ferkol]] could have a chance to play some real guitar in this one, and of course he showed his colors as a metal guitarist, sending me a duet between harmonized voices. [[artist:david-ko|David Ko]] also appears on this track as the gently-spoken backup vocalist."

It never ended up getting used, but other people liked it, and eventually a remix of it ([[track:carefree-victory|Carefree Victory]]) made it into the comic. The original was pretty short, so I lengthened it so that I could eventually get it onto an album. Like [[track:sburban-reversal|Sburban Reversal]], I recommended it as a bonus track.\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/11905462064))\n\nDays before the release of *Homestuck Volume 8,* I lucked out and was offered the opportunity to make track art.  I chose “Carefree Action” and wound up with a cute 8-bit tune.  It’s a lighter version of [[track:carefree-victory|“Carefree Victory”]] from *[[album:homestuck-vol-4|Volume 4]]*. The 8-bit sound and peppiness of the song gave me the idea of Jade and Dave collecting frogs as they would coins in a video game.\n\n<s>I have a hi-res image, but this is all I can post for now.</s>"

It's good! Hadley is responsible for such HS songs as [[Harlequin]] and [[track:blackest-heart|Blackest heart]].\n\nYou might have noticed I've scaled back the frequency of music releases somewhat. It was becoming sort of intense getting one or more albums ready for release every month. It also did start to feel like *maybe* just a little bit too much music coming at you all the time. I'd like to make sure the novelty of these doesn't deteriorate too quickly. Hence a single release seemed like a nice way to mix it up for now. I would expect albums to come out closer to every two months from now on.\n\nOn that note, I'll make an announcement about plans for the next album shortly. Preemptive tl;dr - it will be a contest.

For the next album, I thought it would be fun to open the music submissions up to everybody.\n\nThere seems to be a large number of musicians in the readership outside the music team, who often work on their own HS fan music or remixes. I've had quite a number of people express interest in submitting music to HS over the years, but to keep the team from ballooning out of control, I've had to draw the recruitment line somewhere. This strikes me as a nice opportunity to give a lot of other creative people a chance to contribute music. The music team was originally assembled just before HS began with the idea that I wanted MSPA stories to largely build and develop through contribution from the readership, and I think this album idea is very much in the spirit of that original premise.\n\n<b>The challenge</b>\n\nIf you want to submit music, the idea is simple. Pick a character from Homestuck, and make a song for that character. It can be any character, particularly those in identifiable categories, like the eight human kids, the trolls, ancestors, agents, exiles, Midnight Crew, Felt. If you want to pick a character not in one of those groups, that's fine too. Keep in mind there's a decent chance that if your song is picked, it could be reallocated to a different character, since it's expected we'll get a lot of submission overlap, and it's not going to be \"The Album of 50 Karkat Songs!\" So picking a character for your song is just a starting point for you, and we'll sort it all out during the selection process.\n\nYou can submit up to three songs. No more than that, or they will not be considered! They can be for three different characters, or the same character, whatever you want. You can do remixes, etc. of other HS songs, but we'll have to run it by the original artist, and they'll have some stake in the song's sales.\n\nI am hoping to include as much artist diversity as possible in the final list. Ideally, one artist per song. So while you may submit up to 3, if one of your songs is picked, it'll likely be only one. If you have a lot of music you're dying to send, hopefully the 3 song max will mitigate any agonizing decisions over which to send.\n\n<b>The Prize</b>\n\nIf your song is picked, it will be included with the album! That's pretty much the extent of the prize. You'll get a cut of the album sales, in proportion with how many songs you have in the album to the total number of songs.\n\nAlso, if this contributes any motivation for you, I'm going to try to make a point of using at least one song from this album in a future animation.\n\nI think that should be all the info you need to get started. Everybody is already super psyched to hear what you come up with. Happy music makin!\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120412154625/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/))\n\n<b>coloUrs and mayhem: Universe A</b>\n\nHere is the first part of the album contest results. We divided it into two albums because we ended up picking a large number of songs, and this seemed like the best way to present so much music, while also giving it all a clear theme related to the story.\n\n[[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-b|\"coloUrs and mayhem: Universe B\"]] will be next, scheduled for release on 4/13. It will have the same number of tracks (32).\n\nThanks to all who submitted music and track art!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20120405160556/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/colours-and-mayhem-universe-a))\n\nIncludes tracks by:\n\n[[artist:willow-ascenzo]]<br>\n[[artist:yan-rodriguez|Yan \"Nucleose\" Rodriguez]]<br>\n[[artist:first-turn-fold]]<br>\n[[artist:samm-neiland]]<br>\n[[artist:bleed-binary]]<br>\n[[artist:nathan-h|Nathan \"EbonHawk7x\" H.]]<br>\n[[artist:max-wright|Max 'Imbrog' Wright]]<br>\n[[artist:kezinox]]<br>\n[[artist:plumegeist]]<br>\n[[artist:ian-white|Ian \"MyUsernamesMud\" White]]<br>\n[[artist:eston-schweickart|Eston \"silence\" Schweickart]]<br>\n[[artist:decon-theed|repeatedScales]]<br>\n[[artist:dj|DJ 最テー]]<br>\n[[artist:frank-haught]]<br>\n[[artist:kera-jones|Kera L.

              "Commentary": "<i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>\nIf [[Violet Mariner]] was the elder child and [[Teal Hunter]] the middle child, then Rust Servant is the youngest child onto which I poured all my love and affection. This was one of my favorite pieces to work on and even today I'm still pretty pleased with how it turned out, from the striking staccato and col legno strings opening the song to the frantic violins, melancholic chromatic percussion, deep brass, and fast-paced drum grooves. I wanted the song to be big, epic, a little scary. If I may be so immodest, I think I succeeded.\nRust Servant was the only one of my three contest submissions to remain allocated to the character I had in mind while writing it, Aradia's tragic ancestor and Lord English's dreadful Handmaid (although the name was changed from the terribly uncreative Handmaid of Death to something more apt for the naming scheme of the album).\nWhen I wrote this song, I had just taken an Intro to Hinduism class the previous fall and had written a short research paper on Kali, the Hindu goddess of time and death (more remembered for being related to death—those of you who have seen Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom must be familiar with the Thuggees, a cult of Kali-worshipers infamous for conducting human sacrifices—and, apparently, ripping people's hearts out and setting them on fire as well). And, of course, because I am A SHAMELESS HOMESTUCK NERD, I immediately thought, \"Time? Death? THAT REMINDS ME OF ONE OF THE TROLLS\" (no I didn't write my paper on that, i'm not that terrible). It doesn't come through much in the song itself, but that's where I got the inspiration from. And the moral of this story is, take a theology class (or two, or three) on a religion you know nothing about. It'll give you all sorts of new ideas for Homestuck fanart.\nAlso when the album came out and this song was the first song on the album after Radiation's intro I was all \"HOLY SHIT RADIATION LIKED THIS SONG SO MUCH HE MADE IT THE FIRST SONG\" and started pelvic-thrusting across my dorm room. Then I realized that it was only first due to all the tracks being organized from lowest to highest by the blood color of the troll they represented. I continued pelvic-thrusting across my dorm room anyway.\nAnd to wrap things up, milkmanner's art for the track is just perfect."

              "Commentary": "<i>Yan Rodriguez:</i>\nThis track is one I sure as hell put a ton of effort into, as it was my big chance to finally do something with my music. I was at a pretty good time of my life and I was able to work on this thing day in and day out, and so I did, but first I put a lot of though into what I wanted to actually do. I'm a bit of a contrarian when it comes to making music, always trying to figure out what everyone else does so that I could do something different, and so I wanted to make a theme for Tavros that looked at his character from a more serious perspective about what he was and what he wanted to do. It's original title, \"If I were like Rufio,\" reflected the melancholy desire to be something or be in a world where he was great, where he was a hero but in reality he couldn't really amount to much, and it was his own fault.\nFor the style of the song I ended up falling back on one of my main styles, which I called \"orchestral cinematic/game with a hint of latin rhythms and harmonies.\" I don't really know what it might actually be called. Unfortunately, while this made the song accomplish what I wanted it to, it can be a bit hard to listen to at times, for being too dependent on situation and scenery.\nHowever I'm very proud of it! I got to practice a lot of new and old things and combine them into what's currently my longest song! Well, longest I'm not ashamed of. It ended up being allocated to the Summoner, and I had a feeling it would. I'd say close enough, but it feels a bit weird to say that! I wouldn't change much about it, but I think it's a bit bland, and I've learned a lot from that."

A fairly self explanatory title in light of it being about Bec, methinks.\n([YouTube](https://youtu.be/QZqYLuCH62Q))\nSo this is Gold Pilot, the song I wrote for the Homestuck album Colours and Mayhem. This song has become the theme of the Psiioniic (and it works freakishly well as such) but I wrote it originally in honor of Bec (to the dismay of some).\nThe song recently made it into the actual comic as the music for the Act 6 Act 6 Intermission 1 animation. (totally took me by surprise!)\nEnjoy, Homestuck fans, and others alike!"

              "Commentary": "<i>Willow Ascenzo:</i>\nTeal Hunter was sort of the middle child of my three Homestuck music contest submissions. Even now it's still my least favorite of the three songs I submitted. Why Radiation picked it along with my other two, I'll never know. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be chosen. With over a thousand submissions I'm sure there was no shortage of Redglare songs for him to choose from. Maybe the $20 I slipped him when I submitted my songs had something to do with it But his ways are not our ways.\nWhen Volume 9 came out, a lot of people looked at Radiation's arrangement of Stress by Buzinaki and started noting similarities between it and Teal Hunter. Radiation wrote about why the two songs sound similar in his commentary for Stress. If we're going to talk about \"what sounds like what\", then I'll lay my cards on the table and state that Teal Hunter was begun as pretty much a direct reference to [00 Gundam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt_0Lg4-RkE) from the Gundam 00 soundtrack (if you can't tell by now, I really like Gundams). When I started the piece, the first draft was more or less a low-rent version of that song, in the same way a cartoon that wants to parody Indiana Jones would get a song that sounds close to John Williams' Raiders March without being close enough to qualify as plagiarism. So I just kept fiddling with it until the two melodies sounded different. By the time I got to the final product and had added the buildup in the beginning, the two had nothing but their rhythm and syncopation in common.\nTeal Hunter's original title was Bête Blanche, a play on bête noire, a French phrase literally meaning \"black beast\" that the fan name \"Bec Noir\" is most likely a reference to. As evident, the song was originally allocated to PM, the one Exile powerful enough to battle Jack Noir to a stalemate."

              "Commentary": "<i>Max Wright:</i>\nFor those of you who didn't know, Cobalt Corsair was originally a theme for Hussie. The song being given to Mindfang, while some find it hilariously ironic, I find to be a lot more fitting. I do have a tendency to write piratey sounding orchestral songs; this time it just happened to be accidental! For this commentary, I'm going to be dividing the song up both by sections and instrument groups.\n<b>SECTION I - REGAL</b>\nI always wanted the piece to sound dominating and over-important, at least for this part. It begins with a solo flugelhorn playing its melody, providing an entrance for the rest of the orchestral. After not too long, the trumpets blasting out their fanfare in perfect 4th intervals, the lower brass backing them up with a strong chordal harmony - the brass works to create a very regal sound. Though Hussie as a character isn't anywhere near this serious, I felt that it wouldn't hurt to portray him in such a way - the way his character sees himself. The whole thing reeks of overlording and power, which, as it turns out, seems to fit the pirate idea nicely.\n<b>SECTION II - BROODING</b>\nThis is where the piece changes from 12/8 to 4/4, and the solo flugelhorn returns to introduce the new section. I imagined this to be the other side of Hussie, calculating, always working, creating his world. The whole section is just a build up of instruments, as the lower string ostinato loops itself over. There isn't really much to say about this section, but it certainly works as a contrast for the rest of the piece.\n<b>SECTION III - EXECUTION</b>\nThis is the final minute of the piece, just after the moment of silence. It explodes into a wall of sound, seeking to bring back the power of the first section in a more open way. I actually wrote part of this section before working on the rest of the piece, so naturally, it's what set the general tone. My favourite melody is introduced in this section (played most obviously by the flutes), and I regret not being able to flesh the idea out more. The piccolo part rising above the rest is interesting - it fits perfectly in with the whole pirate theme, despite me never considering this to be a pirate song. I suppose I consider this section the execution of various plans, to a successful conclusion.\n<b>INSTRUMENT GROUPS</b>\nNow, as you can probably tell from listening, Cobalt Corsair is very dense texturally. To give you a visual idea, here's a post from a little while ago showing the layout of the sequencer. [It's big.](https://imbrog.tumblr.com/post/23713453688/did-i-ever-mention-just-how-long-cobalt-corsair)\nSo, I've decided to chop the piece up in terms of the instrument groups, for anyone who wanted to understand what the hell is going on underneath all that sound.\nBRASS | STRINGS | WOODWIND | PERCUSSION AND MISCELLANEOUS <i>(dead dropbox links)</i>"

There is simply too much music out there in the world, and it is impossible to listen to it all. Sorry again, and thank you to everyone who alerted us as fast as possible.\n\nSuitable replacements for those tracks will be sought out in the future.\n\nFor those wondering, the legal holdups we were having <em>weren’t</em> about sampling or song sources.\n\n<i>phonebox:</i> ([MusicBrainz album annotation](https://musicbrainz.org/edit/54390001), excerpt)\n\nThe original tracks 10 and 11 were almost identical copies of tracks on Frozen Synapse Original Soundtrack. Indigo Archer sounds like [\"Switch\"](https://nervoustestpilot.bandcamp.com/track/switch) and Purple Tyrant sounds like [\"A Functioning God\"](https://nervoustestpilot.bandcamp.com/track/a-functioning-god).\n\n<b>How similar are the tracks exactly?</b> They are the same length and sound identical. Audacity or a similar program can be used to invert one of the Frozen Synapse tracks and to try to find out how a copied track was edited. The parts which are exactly the same will turn into silence. Using this method and adding an amplify effect with a value of -1.363 dB to the original Frozen Synapse tracks (or +1.363 dB to the copies), the end result is as follows: in both Indigo Archer and Purple Tyrant the only sounds which were left are electric cracks and creaks. They appear mostly rhythmically with the bassline of the beats. Probably the only part where the added creaking can be clearly heard without having to do editing is in the Purple Tyrant track at 2:30. Elsewhere the the cracks are lost in the beats.\n\n<i>Toby Fox:</i> (contest management, [Tumblr](https://web.archive.org/web/20150114103238/http://fwugradiation.tumblr.com/post/20395391831/source-of-what-was-once-purple-tyrant-by-paul))\n\nSource of what was once “Purple Tyrant” by [Paul Taylor, aka nervous_testpilot](https://nervoustestpilot.bandcamp.com).\n\nReally fabulous and ominous track.

Before I started composing this song I listened to a shit-ton of battle music from Koh Otani's Shadow of the Colossus soundtrack, and it shows. Oh, boy, does it show, especially from 0:49 onward with the rhythm and percussion of the piece.\nViolet Mariner was the first song I started working on for the Homestuck music contest that eventually became the coloUrs and mayhem dual album. It's a song about Dualscar—but it wasn't always a song about Dualscar. No, it started out as a song about John. This explains the harp/piano section, which plays with the opening melody to Showtime, vaguely darting near it without ever actually producing the exact notes from Malcolm Brown's original song. I intended it to be more of a hint of John's original strife theme than a direct reference. In hindsight, keeping the references to existing Homestuck leitmotifs subtle was a smart idea. If I'd been more overt in my references and just made it a straight-up Doctor remix or an explicit arrangement of Showtime, it would have been really hard to reallocate it to a different character. And I'm happy that Violet Mariner is a Dualscar song. Dualscar needs more songs. And also it gave Radiation an excuse to almost name it \"Violet Seaman\". And besides, it means I still technically haven't used the original title, Heirstrike, yet."

Every 30 seconds or so represents a time in the Condesce's life as we know it up to now and, while the song is almost wholly original, I did pull a few minor, but very recognizable things from songs like [[track:liquid-negrocity|liquid negrocity]] and [[track:twoward2-the-heaven2|Twoard2 the Heaven2]] to help really nail the connection.\n([SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/kezinox/witching-hour))\nThis is my song entry for the Homestuck Music Contest--essentially a dark electro house song for the Condesce.

              "Commentary": "<i>Plumegeist:</i>\nAround mid-2011 I was at a Nippon Ichi binge. Disgaea 4 was my most anticipated title of yesteryear and I ended up clocking roughly 300 hours in it. Playing it was essentially what finally made me look at the bigger picture when it came to how Disgaea structured it's entire universe, and if you know me, I love fictional universes with established rules and boundaries that are cleverly told.\nDuring the time I was playing the game I had roughly three or four pipe-projects when it came to comics or visual stories in general, some of which I will delve into soon enough, but generally I come up with ideas for storytelling around one basic principle and I keep them in an idea bucket for whenever I plan on working on them. The projects are things I hope to blend audio and visual presentations to, and as such I often tend to compose music with these projects in mind. Playing Disgaea as such gave me a new idea for a story I since abandoned, and was basically a story of a witch traveling worlds. I decided eventually to experiment a bit with creating some music for a scenario I had in mind, and the only thing I would eventually get out of it was a clarinet melody. The original inspiration was to be Tenpei Sato's compositions but I never really got to finish it since my laptop had a meltdown.\nIn 2012 I got my laptop back and had backups of all my music files at bay, and noticed that MSPA was having a music competition. The limit was three tracks, and as such I wanted to compose three original pieces just to have a shot at getting in. While I got to composing two however, I was stuck at figuring out where I was going to go with the third one, and I realized that I still had a completely unattributed, unfinished track at hand with this work in progress. After recovering the file, rearranging a bit and ultimately rendering it, I decided I'd send it to the contest since I wasn't going to really get anywhere with the track. I figured the character it fit the most was Aradia, so I put it under her name and finished it.\nThe idea was to have it be a bit of a grim little insidious melody for a title character, but somehow it ended up being slightly more Grant Kirkhope-ish during the N64 era in retrospect, which is something I have to say I'm kind of proud of since he's a massive inspiration. I eventually got the call back from Radiation during late February and was told that it won a spot. I was in shock and awe at that point, as it meant that I finally got somewhere substantial with my work. Immediately I re-rendered Rust Maid; then titled Apocalypse Maid, and Orange Hat, and sent it along What Pumpkin's way.\nHere's a fun fact though. When Radiation contacted me, he told me that the song was to be retitled \"Rust Servant\", and was to be the Handmaid's theme. This was something I was okay with, but he immediately contacted me a while afterwards and reassigned the character to it's original intended character. Between a few e-mails exchanged by me and him, we still referred to the actual track as \"Rust Servant\", until I got my contract which had it titled \"Rust Maid\". I thought this was a contract mistake of some sort, but imagine my surprise when I saw the first track on the album thinking it was mine and not realizing it was adhering to a color scheme. Rust Servant was fucking awesome though.\nAnother fun fact - there's a cowbell right at the start that wasn't supposed to be there. I don't even know how it got there. The original sound file was a reverse cymbal. It happened sometime after I recovered the file and I didn't notice it until after I listened to the remastered version again."

Absolute madness.\nSo. Gold Mage. Originally known as \"Playtime is Over\" and written for Dirk Strider before being repurposed to Sollux. Probably my most successful song, before I wrote that remix of Amalgum from Undertale. The very first piece of music I ever made money on.\nI shan't lie; I'm not as fond of this song as I used to be. Not because of the Homestuck connection or anything; simply because it's just too repettitive. Enough so that it lead to why the eventual remix of it turned out the way it did (too busy and cluttered in places - [[track:gold-mage-playtime-is-over-mix]]) It was so with purpose; I did intend for lyrics to go over this- I even wrote a few- but never recorded anything. But honestly, I can't quite bring myself to hate it. The chords are quite nice, what melodies there are + the basslines are pretty slick, and it was my first major musical success. Though the royalties have since slowed way, way down- it's like £10 every four months, if that- it was a major deal when it first dropped as a part of coloUrs & mayhem: Universe A. Even Toby Fox and (assuming I'm not misremembering entirely) Andrew Hussie had nice things to say about it- directly comarping it to EarthBound-type stuff and being astounded it was written, from the ground up, in a PS1 game.\nI may not be much into Homestuck these days, and I definitely think the song is showing it's age... but, hell, it's special to me all the same. One of the most integral pieces of my early music career by a wide margin."

I felt pretty good about Bronze Rebel, and I had a feeling I was only going to get one track on anyway I didn't have high hopes for this one. In fact this one was the \"let's make something I don't think others will like as much\" song. And it might be true, I can't really tell!\nI had to fight myself to get this song done, since I wasn't feeling good and I still wanted to put out something quality. I had really wanted to make something for Vriska, but I didn't have great sounds to do it, but Solatrus convinced me to try a hand at it anyway, to see if I could do something different with Vriska. Unfortunately, what I had in mind still ended up being like what a lot of people already ended up having as \"Vriska\" ingrained in their mind from previous official homestuck music. I was a little disappointed about that, but after having spent days staring at the ceiling trying to figure out what I should do, I realized I just needed to make something.\nThe drums were the first thing I had in my mind that I knew I needed to make a certain way, and the way I made the guitar do 9th intervals was initially an accident that worked out for the best. I'm also pretty happy with this one, I only wish I had better samples or actual guitar instead of the weird twangy and low impact stuff I currently do."

Don't try to tell me otherwise\n\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before\nYou see a thousand of me (thousand of me) and this is what we're made for\n\nFrom now on I know I'll be more careful where I tread\nI'm alive, I'm smiling, I'm so tired of being dead\n\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before (The time will come when you'll see)\nYou see I'm far from empty, I'm back to what I live for (What lies in your destiny)\n\nI see in full clarity what was so muddy before (The time will come when you'll see)\nYou see I'm far from empty, I'm back to what I live for (All of your predestiny)",

It was for the Homestuck Fan Album, which actually turned out to be 2 albums lol.  So yup, I entered, and I was one of the winners, in fact it's actually the first track (track 1 is an opener)... I'm kinda astonished by that today, but I guess it fits!\nAbout the song, I called it Cosmic Surgeon because of John and that big drill thing he did... And the whole cancer thing.. So I guess the song did kinda cater as a theme for him already.  What a coincidence that as soon as I make a remix, I can enter it into a contest right away and it actually wins.  When I wrote it, I just really wanted to capture how the entire comic made me feel at the time, especially after watching Cascade.  It's a theme for John, but I also think of it as kind of a real \"Homestuck\" theme for the entire thing, I guess, as a lot of people kinda obsess over Doctor...\nAnyway, I remastered this version of the song, and added a few other elements, and instrument balance, per a couple suggestions by Radiation Fox... So you can think of this as more of a Cosmic Surgen v. 0.1..."

The first five notes are from Chorale for Jaspers, and I used that twice in the song. I also used the chord progression that's often used in Sburban Jungle in the middle section with the drums, organ, piano and strings. (actually, a lot of homestuck songs) but the rest of it is original I'm pretty sure.\n([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rf5X2PbLNfQ&lc=UgzZnx3ouFO3y5zD49B4AaABAg))\n<blockquote>I thought I heard Black Hole/Green Sun, and also, if you squint your ears just right, it sounds a bit like The Dangerous Symphony (not a Homestuck song)</blockquote>\nBlack Rose/Green Sun is a great song. I did use the same sort of chord progression that's in there. It shows up in a lot of Homestuck songs though I think."

Nonetheless, I think it turned out great. I had a battle between Hephaestus and Dave in mind as I wrote the piece, and took inspiration for it from the first few boss fights in the game Dark Souls."

              "Commentary": "<i>David Ellis:</i>\nWhen I started writing the pieces for the contest I knew I wanted one of them to be based around a theme that already existed. Running through a few ideas I landed on doing a kind of jazzy shuffle piece around the main theme from 'The Beginning of Something Really Excellent'. As soon as I hit the first chord with the Rhodes piano it became smooth. The writing process was really quick and the piece was almost completely sketched out on the keyboard in one go. As the piece was intended for Jade - given the use of the earlier theme - I added in a little bass solo.\nTechnical note: Sometimes when I think I've finished writing something I'll find that it's a bit too long and something needs to change, this was one of those times. The sound you hear at 3:53 is the sound of me finding a way to avoid playing an extra intro/verse and tightening up the song a bit. Using almost the same build up heard earlier in the piece and changing the resolution at the end has the added advantage of (hopefully) making you think it's heading back towards the intro riff until the key shifts in the last bar and the song jumps straight to the final chorus."

I felt that the theme that became the chorus to this piece needed to be at a higher tempo than the rest of that song so I took it out and based this tune around it instead. It was originally titled 'Heir of the Dog' as I was still thinking it could be either a Jade or a John piece at the time and wasn't certain who I'd end up submitting it for (also because terrible puns).\nTechnical note: Although the piece features keyboard and guitar solos the bass was actually the hardest part to play, in particular during the chorus and the part behind the guitar solo.\nExtra: This is no longer true since I recorded [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGLUBAgOS7E). For the original recording the two handed parts in the verses and the outro were originally done as 2 separate takes for each one. It wasn't until I started the video that I thought 'I could turn these into single parts' and made things really difficult for myself."

              "Commentary": "<i>Ryan Ames:</i>\nI don't want to clog up the audio post so I figured I'd make a separate post for my reasoning behind the different parts of the song!\nFirst off, the song itself was inspired by the mental image of Roxy jumping through fenestrated planes to get to a bunch of different places (hence the name Void Hopper). I tried capturing various aspects of her interests and personality through the different sections so it's less of a Theme For Roxy than it is a Song About Roxy. There is still a particular melody that can be heard throughout all three major sections, so I suppose could be the MAIN THEME?\nANYWAY...... ==>\n<b>Section 1. [0:00-0:56]</b>\nThis section is meant to represent her childish and playful side. Roxy always seemed to have this child-at-heart quality about her, what with her infatuation with cutesy wizards and her bedroom in the beta session.\nThe beginning is an obvious nod to Harry Potter. She's totally into wizards so I felt it was appropriate. It then turns into a waltz rendition of Jasper's theme because she is also totally into cats. Then we have a neato transition that I guess could be her travelling through a window or something? I put a spacey sounding pad there to emphasize the VOIDINESS of it.\n<b>Section 2. [0:56-2:24]</b>\nAfter the transition, it picks up speed and has a variety of computer-y and sci-fi effects to hopefully capture her HACKER attribute. The bassline to Aggrievance can also be heard here as a callback to the STRIFE! between Mom and Rose. After that, we have the main theme again, this time accompanied by a busy slap bassline because I love slap bass. This and the following parts were an attempt to convey her get-shit-done attitude and her assertiveness with what she believes in. It could also be a cool action sequence. I imagine her rushing to reach a destination in time by jumping through windows and stuff all badass-like and it's a pretty fitting mental image for her I think!\nAnyway, after this, it all ends with a booze snooze. The song slows down and gets kind of tipsy sounding before glitching out into white noise.\n<b>Section 3. [2:25-END]</b>\nRoxy is asleep and we are now on Derse. This last section is meant to represent her sleepwalking around the void. We have a little sad sounding ocarina melody which then makes way for the main theme to play one last time on violin. The song finally ends on an ominous and spooky note as Roxy drifts further and further into the void.\nWow I did not expect to type this much. Anyway this song was a blast to make and even if it's not accepted, I still learned a whole lot! I hope you all enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it!"

              "Commentary": "<i>Elisa McCabe:</i>\nFirst of all I have this unreasonably intense love of Jake that I can't really entirely explain. Uh. So I definitely wanted to do a song for him. The main idea I started out with was that I'd do a song with two parts, the first part representing Grandpa Harley, then I'd have it morph into the second part, which would be for post-scratch Jake. I first thought of having a literal record scratch but man that sounded dumb :] I referred to the first part, to myself, as Grandpa Harley, and the second part as Hellmurder Island.\nFor the Grandpa Harley part, I spent about half an hour listening to/watching ragtime piano and vaudeville acts on youtube, to refresh myself on the types of intervals and suchlike that they used. Then I just made it up.\nI wanted to make Hellmurder Island really dramatic. I had some (not particularly complicated) scenes of Jake running around on his island that I was making it a soundtrack for. Like...the first section is just...running around in the jungle. Then there's him standing at the top of this huge waterfall, and some birds take off, and the last part is him fighting something or being about to enter the SBURB session. Whatever shit is about to get real for him. :3\nThe song is mainly influenced by ELO's 'Jungle', haha. Mainly in the way it goes, \"duh DUH, duh DUH!\" I love how that sounds. I tried to do more jungley percussion but it didn't end up sounding that good. I made the drum track in this app, which I pretty much use for all my drum tracks cuz it's awesome.\nI did everything except the guitar - which was my bandmate playing - in Garageband using my midi keyboard and various soundfonts. I'm so in love with the one that does the main melody. It's a flugelhorn. It just sounded so much like Jake to me!"

Instruments used in the piece are:\n\n- Acoustic Guitars\n- Accordion\n- Whistle Synth (fun fact, I'm pretty sure it's the same one as used in Horchestra)\n- Banjo\n- Harmonica (1:14, panned left)\n- Violin/Fiddle\n- Full string section (1:28)\n- Maracas, castanets, very very faint snare (you can hear it at 0:10, under the whistle), constant bass drum beat\n- bang bang wink\n\nI also gave the original Showtime strife mix a few listens for the purpose of structuring my piece - after all, it's meant to be a Strife theme. However, pretty much all sources of inspiration were only used in the parts before the banjo solo; the rest was just me having fun with music.\n\nLet me also point out that it made me extremely happy to see in canon that Jake bounces from side to side before he is about to fight; it was the exact image of him I was hoping for.\n\nAlso, while composing, I imagined Dapper Dueling to fit a fight scene similar to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGCMfprPJoA), from Sherlock Holmes (2009).\n\n<i>Max Wright:</i> (composer, [YouTube description](https://youtu.be/clnLNQkB5O4), excerpt)\n\nThis was my interpretation of a Jake Strife theme. After the intensity of [[Cobalt Corsair]] I wanted to make something fun to listen to, and ended up with this. Imagine Jake English bouncing nimbly from side to side, facing off to wrestle his eager opponent.\n\n<i>Soju:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://sojubrew.tumblr.com/post/12754503873), [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/shilloshilloh/art/Homestuck-Jake-English-268874606), excerpt)\n\nObligatory Jake art, 30 min doodle that I took too seriously ;7;\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/dapper-dueling-full.jpg\" width=\"375\">"

              "Commentary": "<i>Elaine Wang:</i>\nFun facts:\n\"Dord\" is a rather amusing typographical error that occured back in 1934 when someone in the Merriam-Webster editing staff misread \"D or d\", intended as abbreviations for density, as \"Dord\" and... made up a pronunciation for it. (Whoops.)\nGiven Roxy Lalonde's penchant for drunk typing^W^W lexicographical creativity, I thought it was appropriate. The accidentals, at least as much so. As for the waltz part of it... well, I have no idea either.\nIt was written as a Roxy song. It will now be a Roxy song until the end of the Internet.\nI came up with the title first and the music second. The accidentals were there the first time I put down the notes. (They are going to stay there.)\nThe above is not normal for me. I have more recently taken to using random word generators to title my music, because I often struggle with that.\nI am told that the song has some similarities to Endless Climb. That part is most definitely not deliberate. Not going to rule out subconscious influences though.\nThe album art is by merrigo. She (?) does cool work. Go look at her tumblr too.\n\"Dord\" is a real thing that happened in the Merriam-Webster in the 1934 edition. Read the article for more information.\nA dord is also a kind of instrument. There's none of them in the song, just so's you know.\nAlthough if you're willing to play Dord on a dord I can send you sheet music.\nFull disclosure: I'm not actually finished with the Dord sheet music. Remind me in two weeks and I'll probably have something.\nThe above two points also apply even if you aren't going to play Dord on a dord. (I have no idea what the range of that instrument is, so whatever.)"

Still in our stage costumes we opened our cans of Dr. B and casually sat around his bedroom. Computers were turned on, subwoofers were turned up. And so it began that we started remixing.\nNearly two months later we sat in the back of a van amongst instruments and gear on our way to play another concert, this time at a Houston anime convention. Computers were turned on, headphones were turned up. It was here that Crystalmethequins, begun so many weeks earlier, was finally completed.\nAfter deciding that the track art would not be a hastily photoshopped image of troll Bryan Cranston, I came to someone I trusted. Richard Gung is unarguably the master, and his track art was well worth the cost he took from me in that dark alley.\nThe song was chosen from among its peers to open Volume 9. There it stands proudly to this day."

It's time to talk about Anbroids 2.0! Hands up everyone who thought \"Brobots\" would've been a better name? Yeah that's what I thought... Still! Here we are so let's commence the proceedings:\n<b>THE CONCEPT</b>\nSo much of the inspiration here comes directly from Davesprite, which I remember thinking \"Oh god damn if that Yamaha YM2612 Genesis/Mega Driveness doesn't fit Dave quite well!\".  Enter Dirk Strider and his robotic creations! Suddenly a synthy, retro chiptune doesn't sound so out of place.\nMy idea was formed fairly early on after we'd learned a bit of his pastime.  I came up with the idea of having a kind of \"Workshop\" theme where Dirk would put some music on and get to work constructing some brobot or other.  From here there was a number of prerequisites:\n<ol><li>Must be kinda funky. Dude's a Strider after all. So we're looking at a bit of a groove with the beat.</li> <li>Must have square waves, which is sort of the national instrument of Robonia.</li> <li>Solos!</li></ol>\nAll this in mind, I nabbed a general purpose Genesis soundfont (Which seems to be comprised of voices mainly nabbed from Sonic, certainly the percussion is - You should be able to recognize the snare from the opening riff of Sonic the Hedgehog). And got to work.\n<b>NAME</b>\nYeah, so I thought \"Brobots\" would've been a better name, especially because that became their canon name in the comic, but by then Hussie had used it in the comic under the name Anbroids, so it stuck :p I apended a 2.0 on it because the versions became fairly different.  I also figured some people might want the original version 1.0 used in the comic after the album came out.\nSpeaking of which...\n<b>VERSION ONE</b>\n[\\[LISTEN TO] IT HERE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ICTFBDONdI)\nThis was an in progress version that Hussie nabbed early on before I'd made changes to create the newer version.  I'll go into why it changed in a bit, but here's a good place to discuss the track at large:\nThe main theme is there, but a bit... \"Lazier\" - It doesn't have a lot of the swing it'd later develop.  It also opens with just a percussive riff, which is probably most influenced by the likes of Toejam 'n Earl.  Overall I reckon this version lacked energy, so it needed a bit of a rework before I reckoned it was cool enough to be a Strider song...\n<b>VERSION TWO</b>\nThe percussive intro was removed in favor of a \"Booting up\" thing (Just a pitch bended squave), followed by a not-so-subtle parody of the original Game Boy bootup noise.  The main \"guitar\" riff came back with a bit of stereo (Which I tried to use a bit more of).\nAt 0:23 we jump into the first of various solos. One of the tricky parts of chiptune music is, yes you have limited channels, voices and often no polyphony (multiple notes on the same track at the same time) so if you want to make it sound realistically retro you need to abide by these laws, but that doesn't mean you can't play with pitch, modulation, stereo etc - The solos were effectively a lesson in mucking about with these to create something that sounded fairly dynamic for a sequenced solo.\nAt 0:40, just before the main melody kicks in, we have the first \"boot error\" sound - Just a flat bass note on the square.  There's one at the end as well - The main concept was while he's building these brobots, occasionally something'll go wrong - It'll fail to start or it'll start going haywire - and so he has to unplug and start again trying something else.\n0:43 has the main melody.  It's similar to the original Version 1 but it's been funked up a bit - Mainly to avoid it sounded like other stuff (I'm looking at you, Lady Gaga's Alejandro). Again, bit of pitch wobbliness to give an air of a kind of hectic, technological mess.\nThe second solo changes the key, and here the idea is Dirk's moved on to working on something else.  As the solo continues, it gets more and more hectic until it's just splattering notes everywhere, like the brobot's gone completely off the rails and it's flailing around the room - At 1:35 it's promptly shutdown and we bridge back into the main melody again (This bridge was removed from V1, but brought back in by, well, Rad's request :p I liked it too though, has a Sonic-y feel to it).\nBit of harmonizing later (partially indicating that the Brobot Dirk's working on has started to play ball and is synchronizing with his personality). One last \"Perfected\" solo (1:58) which is actually a modified version of the original solo that's basically a lot \"wilder\", to show we've finally perfected the upgrade and ready to ship.\nSo with that, everything's shut down, and the song ends.\nGranted, I probably didn't manage to get this little 'story' across with everybody, but this was the general thought process when I was making the thing.  Hopefully if you listen to it now you'll get some of the ideas I was going for. If not? Well... enjoy it however you like :p Or even come up with your own interpretation that's better than mine :p\nJohnathan Griffiths was the track art man of the hour - There's even a mega drive controller there! And how are those shades staying on? All round awesome :)\n\n<i>Jonathan Griffiths:</i>\nMy track art for Anbroids V2.0 by Malcolm Brown off Homestuck Volume 9!\n\nThe track reminded me a lot of Toejam & Earl, so I wanted to have some kind of ridiculous 90s background, and you can’t get more 90s than complementary colors, triangles, and color halftones. ;) Then I gave Squarewave a Genesis controller necklace for good measure.

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nAaah Pumpkin Party in Sea Hitler's Water Apocalypse. Or Pumpkin Party in Colony 413 or whatever I was calling it before I decided to go nuts.  The original working title was just \"Pumpkin Party\", so at the very least we started somewhere sensible.\nSo let's have a chat about where this one came from.\n<b>THE CONCEPT</b>\nSo around about [THIS PANEL](https://www.homestuck.com/story/4852) during Dirk's history lesson of the future, we got a glimpse as to what Roxy was up to - Helping the locals out in the post apocalyptic hell-future.  Some bizarre idea came about that herself and the Carapacians would get together and have a little underground party away from the watchful gaze of the Condensce and her drones and the like.  Gotta find some way to keep your spirits up, right? So with that incredibly vague concept the idea was born to come up with some small light of goodness and happiness in, well, \"Sea Hitler's Water Apocalypse\".\n<b>THE NAME</b>\nAs mentioned this changed a few times, but this line sums up pretty much everything you need to know about the future:\n<code style=\"color: #1f9400\">GT: Like what is even your day to day business like in sea hitlers water apocalypse??</code>\n<b>THE TRACK</b>\nAs I recall, with this one it was mainly the instruments chosen that defined it.  The Banjo just struck the right kind of sound, and from there an accordion to give it a bit of a polka feel.  A lot of the crafting of this one was trying desperately not to have it ending up too much like the Ievan Polkka (Which thanks to a month of Project Diva on PSP is firmly embedded in my brain...).\nThe idea of mixing Chiptune samples and real instruments is something I was playing with a lot this album (Encore does it as well, as did the dropped 'Mother') - I felt this was a kind of neat \"This is where we were, and this is where we are now\" concept.  HS is still about a game, and it's neat to embed some of the more obvious gamey elements now and then.  Plus it might just be me, but accordions and square waves go really well together :D\nThe \"Ooh!\" \"Ahh!\" chants were added just to give it a bit more of a folk appeal, and the air-raid sirens were added last to build up the scene of this party going on while the world's gone to hell outside - perhaps some other colony's getting obliterated for whatever reason.  Either way, it bookends the song quite nicely, coming back now and then and returning at the end to signify the dance is over.\nMy favorite bit of the whole thing is the solo at 1:56 - It's just so gosh darn happy!\nOverall though? It's a bit of a zany, dance-party track.  Completely juxtapositions the hell-nightmare outside, and in the end that's the point!  Of course things get worse, but \"Red Miles In Sea Hitler's Water Apocalypse\" will have to wait...\nDamn, I just realized I should've added some meows.  I've got like two cats sitting here ready for a vocal performance as well... Ah well, the road not taken.\nOnce again the art is very spiffy so many thanks to Marina! Look at that dude in the corner? That pumpkin is so nom'd! :D"

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nBefore this track was used in Homestuck along with Beatfox's \"A Taste for Adventure\", it was actually made for a nearly 3-year-old defunct fan project. Housetrapped was a story about an alternate Sburb session and \"Another Jungle\" was a the-same-but-different theme for the loading screen of that universe's Sburb client. Sound familiar?\nWhen we shifted into gear to create new Homestuck music following the start of Act 6, I was asked to refurbish the forgotten 40-second theme I'd written as the theme to Sburb Alpha. \"Another Jungle\" is thus the alpha equivalent of \"Sburban Jungle\" which I had written back when Homestuck began - structurally both songs are very similar, but each with their own melodies and sound choices.\n\"Another Jungle\" has the benefit of years of experience with production I did not have when Homestuck began, and to me the fidelity difference really shows. Since writing \"Sburban Jungle\" I'd become far more familiar with automation, recording, eq, mixing, mastering, and all the techniques that polish a music project. \"Another Jungle\" is far more dynamic than its predecessor, with each subsequent section of the song having its own unique way of using the instruments and sounds in the project.\nMy favorite touches to this one are all the very mellow sounds that contrast with the brisk pacing of the track - the various pads, the wah-wah guitar, the echoing melody, all of it underlined by drums and brute synth loops. The sudden change in energy when the guitars duck out in the middle and the melody of \"Showtime\" whispers in is a favorite moment of mine. The very pop ending with its retro house sound was another choice I wouldn't have seen myself making three years back. Hope you enjoy this one as much as I do.\nThe art for this track is by Richard Gung."

While this album became Homestuck Vol. 9, a lot of analogous tracks remained from the original concept, including this track as an alternative to \"GameBro (Original 1990 Mix)\" from Homestuck Vol. 6: Heir Transparent.\nWhile we can only imagine what the set-decorating GameGrl magazine from Jane Crocker's bedroom might actually be like, it's pretty easy for me as a child of the 90's to imagine how the magazine might have looked in the era of the Burger King Kid's Club and Lisa Frank. With GameGrl I attempted to capture a lot of the basic messages perpetuated to girls by children's advertising in the 90's:\n- Boys are gross and need to have their butts kicked\n- Girls are cool and should pretend to understand pop culture\n- Clubs must be started in tree-houses and couch forts to keep boys out\n- Parents suck and will never understand\n- You can trust corporate America\nThe music was a hodge-podge of a lot of things - the production style of early 90's house music (Deee-Lite and Cathy Dennis were my main references) was coupled with the intentionally insipid rap vocals in a time in which many game commercials [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkWYP95WbbY) [awful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m__j99flW9w) [raps](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7FN5B02YEo). The lead vocals are performed by Tavia Morra, whose voice I discovered sounds scarily childlike when sped up slightly. We played the backup track at about 75% speed and had her rap over it to create the vocal comp before speeding it back up to create the cringe-worthy little girl voice. I did a digital process to lower my voice to create the [Pokérap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0LoHA_FPAs)-style breakdown towards the middle of the track and then asked Erik Scheele to play a painfully retro midi guitar solo.\nFor the track art (lovingly created and posed for by Tavia) among our many references were Alex Mack and The Olson Twins. The big deal-breaker for us was getting a pair of overalls, a garment seemingly synonymous with the 90's. We spent nearly three hours hunting for a pair in Austin coming up short at Wal-Mart, Academy, Sheplers, Cavender's Boot City, Goodwill, a costume store, a paint store, and a plumbing store before finally finding a wearable piece 17 miles out of town at a farm supply store. Apparently humanity had the good sense to wipe that fucking hideous fashion travesty off the face of the earth at the end of the decade (I knew the y2k bug must have done something!) and now only people who actually need them wear them.\nWe took our pictures at the Japanese-style game center Arcade UFO. Outtakes can be found [here](https://seeyoutmorra.tumblr.com/post/24983253249/some-of-the-other-photos-from-the-gamegrl).\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\nI don't even know where to start.\nOne day Bowman and I discovered that if we pitched my voice up a little higher than where it normally is, then I sounded like a 12 year old girl. The idea for GameGrl came up later and he proceeded to write lyrics that would make any 90's kiddo cringe at the nostalgia of their childhood and want to do it again.\nI had way too much fun recording it to the point that I knocked over a music stand from dancing too much. Bowman was a fantastic coach. It's always a pleasure to work with him.\nThe track art has more of a story to it than I would have cared for, but Bowman and I both knew we had to go all the way with the track art. And so begun our quest for the GameGrl outfit, which we found all of the clothing elements for except for the overalls.\nWe figured we were just going to go around the corner to the Goodwill, find a pair of overalls, slap those suckers on and get the track art done within about an hour tops.\nBut no.\nNo, no, no.\nWe ended up shopping for three hours at nine separate stores before we found those goddamn overalls. Bowman livetweeted our journey:\n<img src=\"media/misc/overall-quest.jpg\" width=\"331\">\nEventually we got the overalls and proceeded to take the most fantastic pictures ever. I'll be posting up some other photos from that day later on so keep your eyes peeled!\nAll in all, this track is probably the most involved I'd been on a Homestuck album and am so glad it was this one. I had a blast!"

Examples include cities, mountains, buildings, individual rooms, even entire planets (see [[album:medium|Medium]]).\n\nAustin is currently my real world home, and to imagine it flooded and empty is a fascinating thing. Should Dirk ever decide to explore beyond Houston, what forgotten worlds would he find in the other lost Texan fortresses?\n\nThe whole song was written to musically explore this sunken Austin, and to deliver a strong atmosphere and sense of place. The parts I used to piece together this portrait are the constituent Homestuck tunes, each of which I chose because of thematic applicability; they include [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]], [[Explore]], [[Flare]], and even [[Atomyk Ebonpyre]].\n\nTo capture the same essence visually in the track art, I knew I could trust [[artist:nic-carey|Tynic]]. She is an incredible background artist with an uncanny sense for colors and composition! I am so proud of her work here; the song just wouldn't be the same without the accompanying artwork.\n\nAdditional fun fact: the entire song is played off key, detuned into the spaces between quartertones. The piano itself is significantly flat. This surprised me in how far it went toward making the song sound \"sunken.\"\n\n<i>Nic Carey:</i> ([Tumblr](https://tynic.tumblr.com/post/24964072895/full-version-of-the-track-art-i-did-for-clark))\n\nFull version of the track art I did for Clark Powell’s track Austin, Atlantis, as seen on Homestuck Volume 9 (get it now go go go music music music)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/austin-atlantis-full.jpg\" width=\"375\">",

I took the idea over to Jit who then helped me develop the picture to what it became, suggesting the [FF7 motorcycle chase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUUbp-4kKMA) as inspiration and to turn the motorcycle in to Sawtooth."

              "Commentary": "<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nart by P-RO at [nomorepros.tumblr.com](https://nomorepros.tumblr.com). P-RO always does a maximally amazing job so why I asked her to draw the art is a non-question.\nStress is actually a pretty faithful arrangement of an original track by Buzinkai. Buzinkai has been responsible for several HS-important melodies like [[Doctor]], [[Endless Climb]], and [[Explore]] and [her] work, for me, has always established a certain \"essence\" of what Homestuck is. My goal for this piece was actually to create a classic strife theme for Dirk with the core feeling of earlier pieces like [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime]] or [[Doctor]], so basing the piece off of something with that \"essence\" was important.*\nI can't say why Buzinkai wrote this piece the way she did, so I'll instead highlight the differences between the original and my arrangement.\n- <p>Updated the instrumentation. Buzinkai's usage of PXTONE is indeed charming and nostalgic-sounding, but I wanted to push things bit further. One major difference is the arrangement of the strings - Buzinkai's PXTONE strings have an sharp attack to them, while mine come on a bit softer but are thicker. My strings then sound more \"lush\" but less \"urgent.\"</p>\n- <p>I added a section between the original A section and B section with lower intensity. This was because the song got a bit too repetitive and static simply repeating like Buzinkai's. Oddly, the repeats didn't bother me in her track. I think this is partially because MY loop point, unlike Buzinkai's, lowers the intensity a LOT more by removing a bunch of instruments where hers simply flows into a repeat. I need to think about that more.</p>\n- <p>Added an introduction and a true ending to make it more of a proper start-to-finish song.</p>\nAbout the similarity to [[Teal Hunter]] and a fun syncopation lesson:\n- <p>This was unintentional - I not only started my arrangement of this song before the contest was conceived, Buzinkai made the original song back in 2010. THOUGH as soon as I heard Teal Hunter I KNEW people would call out the similarities because, surprise, there are plenty of them! Here's the big one:\n- <p>Both pieces are in 5/4 (5 beats per measure, try counting to 5 over and over on the beat) and use the SAME syncopation (syncopation = the division of notes into smaller off-beat rhythms within the measure) throughout the track. Actually, many many many pieces in 5/4 use this syncopation. See: [Hollow Bastion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nlCNVewMjA). Why do composers keep doing this? Two reasons: One, because it sounds awesome. Second, because the main way to compose in odd time signatures like 5/4 or 13/4** is actually to cut things into smaller units of 3, 2, or 4. Though each measure is comprised of 5 total beats, each measure in these songs is cut into 10 notes of half the length going 123-123-12-12. 3! 3! 2! 2!</p> <p>Wow, that was a very poor explanation. But please go to that Hollow Bastion video I linked and count \"one-two-three-one-two-three-one-two-one-two\" very quickly along with each note the harp plays. You'll get it. (And I'm just making things more confusing, but isn't it awesome how the syncopation switches at the end of the  4-measure phrase to \"1234 12 12 12?\" The little bit of contrast makes it feel complete.)</p> <p>So, why don't people just cut things up differently? like 3 2 2 3? it's definitely possible! Here's my theory about why people favor the syncopation they do: It seems like ending a measure with a shorter note ON the beat leads into the next measure more naturally. It even sounds like a leadin: dun-DUN! This is supported by the fact that one of the most popular syncopations in existence is the one in 4/4 that goes 3 3 2. This is probably the same principle.</p> <p>3 3 2: ON OFF ON<br>3 3 2 2: ON OFF ON ON</p>\n- <p>Besides the fact that the syncopation is identical, the chords and melody are similar and the way the strings are used are basically the same. I have no explanation for this other than... great minds think alike???</p> <p>RANDOM FUN FACT: Awakening is also in 5/4, go to 1:40 and sing the melody to Stress. Hell, [[media:misc/stresscombo.mp3|I'll do it for you.]] It fits!!! The main melody of awakening also starts with a similar rhythm as Stress. it's the curse of the 123 123 12 12's.</p>\nWow, I really got off track here. But I hope you learned something today.\n* Yes, Bill Bolin also started an arrangement of this piece before he left the team. I think we were both attracted to the same \"essence\" present in Buzinkai's piece.\n** Bonus challenge: See if you can count out how I divided the measures in this song! If you can do this, you can easily understand how to compose in time signatures like this. It's actually VERY simple and derived directly from the other breakdowns I did."

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nI get the feeling that down the line there will be an explanation for why exactly there's a tiny Maplehoof on Dirk Strider's desk and it will be one of the biggest plot revelations in all of Homestuck. For me it was a cue that there needed to be a Sburb Alpha universe parallel for the song [[track:maplehoofs-adventure]], which in itself was a spiritual sequel to [[Pony Chorale]]. It's sort of a reality check to realize that I have written not one, not two, but three songs for cartoon ponies now - I guess that's part of this disease we call the Internet.\nAs with the previous installments, I used a sample of Tavia Morra saying \"neigh\" to punctuate phrases, this time sped up to about double speed to have that chipmunk-esque effect. Everything about this song is a bit faster-paced and squeakier to reflect the stature of the tiny horse. The orchestration was largely inspired by my last trip to Disneyland - the whistles are arranged to sound a bit like the teapots from Alice in Wonderland, and the horn synths were selected because of their resemblance to a merry-go-round organ.\nAlong with recent tracks like [[track:another-jungle]] and [[track:elephant-gun]], this song represents one of my attempts to stick less closely to a predictable song form. The key signature moves up a whole step around 32 seconds in and never comes back down, and the main repeated refrain that ties the song together is the little cadence that shows up at the end of each section. I stuck to my guns as a high school music theory student on this one, mostly drawing from Mozart and Sousa - it's an overstimulating mess of counterpoint, and my main goal was to see if it would annoy composition major Erik Scheele (it worked).\nOut of all the tracks for Volume 9 I worked on, this one was a real breeze. I was on such a roll that I considered making it ten minutes long just to piss off everyone, but I knew that I'd most likely be asked to cut it down if I'd gone to that kind of excess, and I had other tracks to work on.\nThe track art was done by Tavia Morra.\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\nBowman and I quickly settled on the idea of a picture emphasizing the size of Minihoof, but couldn't decide on a specific way to show it. Maybe put a magnifying glass over the little pony? Having her next to Dirk's hand while he typed on the computer? The energy of the track made us think of little Minihoof running through an obstacle course Dirk set up for her on his desk, thus the stapler, the tacks, the brads, the pencils, and the GameBro Magazines. This was a super fun one for me since I had such a personal investment in it."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nLet's talk about Encore! Or \"Showtime 2: Encore\".\n<b>THE CONCEPT.</b>\nSo back in the early days of Volume 9, the idea was \"The New Session\".  The further idea was to take the tracks 'n themes of Volume 1/Act 1 and 're-scratch' em to come up with a parallel for the new session and the new kids.  Where this idea started to fall to bits was expecting the act to play similarly to Act 1, which it quickly didn't :)\nStill, by this point we had a decent collision of re imagined classic tracks and Strife/character themes for the new kids, so on with the show.\nEncore was a straight-up \"Let's bring Showtime kicking and screaming into the new session, but a little bit mixed, yet still recognizable\".\n<b>THE NAME.</b>\nShould be obvious. \"Showtime\" -> \"Encore\".\n<b>THE TRACK.</b>\nMaking Showtime orchestral wasn't too hard.  The idea of a very pomp-y, brass, adventure-y/combat affair was formed fairly early on - I think the main channeling came from a Power Stone/Smash Brothers-esque \"Zany combat\" idea.\nMost of the voices come from EWQL's Symphonic Orchestra, with a bit of soundfonts for the later Showtime segment.\nThe section at 0:22 has a bit of history - It was originally a straight up Lifdoff arrangement, but I pulled it back and made it considerably less obvious (I've became hesitant of Lifdoff since someone pointed out it sounds like the Bruce Lee story theme :p) - I *did* leave the little brass phrases that punctuated it, which unintentionally/subconsciously might be referencing Earthsea Borealis.  This wasn't intended, but it's probably close enough for it not just to be a coincidence, and enough people seem to be picking up on this accidental reference so what the hell :p\nNext it returns to the alternate Showtime and adds on Unite Synchronization.  Does a floaty little bridge afterwards, and then we get into the original Showtime.\nI pondered adding this for a while, since it felt a bit \"Yes, we get it, this is a Showtime thing, y'don't need to actually add the thing in\", but eventually I liked the idea of it smashing in, completely brazen with its NES-y soundfont and blaring the original track in the last section of the song.  We then wind down with the fast-paced percussion and the starting brass arrangement, just enough time for a post-battle ass-kicking pose, and then \"Boom\".\nI think writing tracks for characters like John/Jake's quite fun in that they've got this bottomless optimism and carefree attitude, plus they do silly things. Silly things are quite fun to score...\nAnd that's Encore! Hope ya'll enjoyed that little trip back down memory lane!\n\n<i>Bea:</i> ([Tumblr](https://beesmygod.tumblr.com/post/24962863472/oh-ok-i-can-post-this-now))\n\noh ok i can post this now\n\nalbum art for “encore” by malcom brown!\n\n♥ʕ◡ᴥ◕`ʔ┏┏"

In this case, I combined 'Explore' and 'English' in a style inspired by the sailing theme from 'Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker'. (It's easy to miss the theme from 'English', since it's a lot more upbeat and in a major key.) I don't use brass a lot when I write, but I think it came out well here.\n\n<i>EsfiArt:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://web.archive.org/web/20180407051347/http://kiddybro.tumblr.com/post/24963870530))\n\nWELP GUESS IT’S TIME TO POST THIS NOW\n\nI got to do album art for Expedition in the new Homestuck album!!!!!\n\nGOLLY THIS WAS FUN TO DO"

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i> (composer)\n\nThis is pure Jake strife music - I started this project with the definite goal in mind to make something that sounded purely like video game music for a battle. Jake English is sort of the archetypal Roosevelt-type swashbuckler with all the bravado of a turn-of-the-century primitivist. For him, the palette of sounds is instantaneous: heavy percussion rumbling at a breakneck pace. I threw in chimes, timpani, xylophone, glockenspiel, cymbal crashes, and an uncompromising drum machine to get the atmosphere I wanted.\n\nI had a nice, retro-sounding portamento synth as a lead, a quick little intro, and a couple of smart little themes going on right at the beginning, and I was all set for this to be one of those simple, memorable themes not unlike one of the previous Strife themes (\"Beatdown\", \"Showtime\"). Then, at 44 seconds in, something snapped - I suddenly decided that what I was writing was boring and that nothing could be normal from that point on. Inspired by a few listens to \"Rollo Interior\", I wrote a rhythmically unconventional breakdown followed by the whole song shifting into \"Zappa chords\" for a little while.\n\nWhat was excellent about working on this track is it's one of the first instances in a while where I had really freed myself from any preconceived goals for the song's form and just decided to write a track from start to finish and see what felt right. I ended up at sort of the golden length - the song begins to loop at 2:15, making it still functional as video game music, and fades out by 2:39. Tavia pointed out to me that pop songs that run a bit short of 3 minutes tend to be incredibly satisfying, especially for a first time listener, as they ask for your attention for an amount of time that doesn't wear you down. Out of all my tracks for Vol. 9, this is the one I find the easiest to listen to on a loop.\n\nThe track art is by 8bitkitten.\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/25391031646))\n\nI was thrilled to get the opportunity of illustrating your music. It’s always so gosh darn fun. =3\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> ([Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/24979824333))\n\nAfter listening to this energetic strife theme, I imagined Jake English is hunting down a pesky Tinkerbull. &gt;:3\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> (alternate artwork, [Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/24979824333))\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/elephant-gun-bonus.jpg\" width=\"300\">\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> ([Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/24982629793))\n\nSo upon browsing Volume 9 on Bandcamp, I noticed my first version of “Elephant Gun” was used which is why I posted that one, but it turns out the edited version where I gave Tinkerbull a nose ring was the one included in the album download?\n\nSorry to those of you who have already reblogged the first version, although I appreciate it either way!  ^__^’"

We sent Jane Dargason back and forth between us, remixing each other's remixes until the track was in its final state. For reference:\n\nThe original sketch put together by RJ [[track:jane-dragon|sounded like this]].\n\nBy the end of the process, things had evolved quite a bit.\n\nI also want to take a moment to say that my good friend [[artist:dawn-davis|Dawn]] did a spectacular job on the track art! She has a wondrous way with colors, and her drawings of the Homestuck kids have a childlike optimism about them. Nothing could have been a more perfect match for a track like this one!"

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nThis track was an attempt to try something in the same vain as the soundtrack to Jet Set Radio Future which was recommended to me by friends Erik Scheele and Richard Gung. Composer Hideki Naganuma has created some of the most intricate and engaging pieces of dance music I've ever heard - his signature approach is his construction of entire songs around only a handful of samples (check out \"Funky Dealer\" for a good example).\nGoing off of the notion that there aught to be some music dedicated to the 3 years that John, Jade, and Davesprite spend by killing time in Ghostbusters 2 MMORPG, I recorded myself singing the famous exclamation uttered by Ray Parker Jr partway through the legendary 1984 single. What is the deal with that line, really? Apparently chasing ghosts isn't just a public service for Mr. Parker - it gets him off.\nThe majority of the track is driven by drum and crowd samples with some very funky but intentionally primitive synths on top. I liked the idea of building up to some big climactic house beat, and the climax of the song is sort of an homage to Kalibration and his EDM project Screamcatcher (albeit missing all the cool).\nThe art is by Victoria Grace Elliott."

When Tavrisprite appeared in the comic, I challenged myself to make a suitable theme at the same pace I might once have cobbled something together back in 2009. I posted the resulting demo track on my Soundcloud the same day as the character made its debut.\n\nMy demo fused the Spanish sounds associated with Tavros and the electric lead guitar associated with Vriska. The result was just over a minute of power-flamenco silliness which I planned to expand upon heavily until suddenly Tavrisprite exploded less than an hour after I uploaded the demo. I decided the song aught to be short and sweet as well, so I asked Thomas Ferkol to play some additional metal guitar at the end before dropping in an explosion effect and a distantly echoing \"honk\" from a certain codpiece-wearing merchant.\n\nThe track art is by 8bitkitten.\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://kitten-burrito.tumblr.com/post/24981766963))\n\nI wanted to compliment Bowman’s rockin’ Tavrisprite theme. }::::)"

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nOne of the things I'd always felt was curious about our re-appropriation of the hundred-year-old vaudeville track by Eddie Morton was the complete contrast between its cheerful mood and the sinister nature of the characters it represents. The Midnight Crew, while fashion-savvy, are cold-blooded murderers, and I'd been curious as to what a darker version of their signature song might sound like.\nThe inspiration for this \"post-punk\" arrangement comes specifically from the Iggy Pop track \"Nightclubbing\", which was produced by David Bowie during their stay in Berlin in 1977. The Iggy Pop and Eddie Morton tracks are very different takes on a night on the town, and I was utterly fascinated by the thought of injecting the old ragtime track with the same seedy atmosphere of Iggy's sardonic croon.\nI'd been playing this particular arrangement live at live shows for a while, and for this recorded version I brought in bandmates Erik Scheele and Marcy Nabors to record their respective parts. Erik delivers the excellent jazz piano, while Marcy added some amazing textures by playing theremin and accordion. I made full use of the wah pedal on my guitar to deliver the very textured guitar performance, and copied Iggy's beloved drum machine loop for the main percussion.\nThe track art is by Cari Garafalo."

Though, having a good instinct for interesting rhythms definitely is why I seem to be so notorious for percussion/drum beats.\nThat said, Portrait is a funny case in particular, and its weirdness is quite a bit more deliberate than the other two, simply because I was more experienced by the time of its release.\nThe song is in mixed meter. Now, you certainly can hash it out to 14/4 and be happy with it, because it works out that way, but the song is actually written in alternating measures of 15/8 and 13/8. Or was it 13/8 and 15/8? It's been awhile. Either way, the song itself never sits still and shifts its pulse back and forth the entire way, and ends up making the later breakbeat/drum and bass part all the more crazy.\nAnd yet it still seemed to work!\nAs for everything since Portrait, any weird percussion I do has been completely deliberate and thought out, because, as I said before, I understand my instincts on it. More importantly, I understand why those instincts work.\nTL;DR; In a past life, I was probably a drummer.\n:D"

My favorite piece of all time is his Firebird Suite, and not far behind is his other ballet the Rite of Spring. The latter is the main inspiration behind this track!\nI listened to the Rite of Spring quite a bit throughout last year and I really was compelled to write something inspired by it. When the End of Act 5 flash came out, Andrew also revealed the now memetic Red Miles attack. I thought of no better way to elude to two of my favorite things than combining them this way! I set out on the concept of making a Rite of Spring-esque movement to fit the devastating attack.\n<b>The Music</b>\nThe direct segment I was trying to parallel is thesecond section. Staccato unbowed strings playing eighth notes on a single chord with an accent pattern. The difference here is that as crazy as that segment may get, Stravinsky wrote the whole thing in 2/4. Red Miles I just had fun and it alternates between 2/4, 7/8, 5/8 and whatever the hell I felt like/8. I had a whole lot of fun with time signatures is what I mean.\nThe accent pattern I use has a bit of history behind it as well. I'm a band geek if no one had noticed yet, and was heavily into marching band during high school. Being a percussionist, I kind of had a love/hate relationship with drumline warmups. One in particular we played waaaaay too much was the accent to tap exercise. For people who don't know too much about drumline, it's just an exercise that warms up the extremes of playing. Most notes are steady pulse beats but then an accent pattern is introduced to differentiate height, sound and velocity between taps (normal strokes) and accents. Ours was called \"Cinco de Mayo\" because it was mostly in 5/8. I took the same pulse (12 123 12 123 123 12 123 12 12 - accents on 1) and applied it to the strings.\nI tried to fully orchestrate it, so the next section introduces an English Horn (oh man english horn I could go on for days about) and a bassoon (also could go on forever fuck yeah double reeds) trading off a little melody between accent patterns akin to Rite of Spring. Then I gave the accent to two timpani (yeah the piece would require two timpanist or an inhuman player) because it's my favorite instrument and I don't incorporate enough percussion into my pieces for a percussionist. The next section introduces the first real theme. I originally wrote these melodies messing around with four mallets on a marimba. I was intending on making something primitive like RoS (hence unmoving bassline) and then translated it to piano then full score. It alternates between d minor and D Major just by tweaking around with the F sharp. Fun stuff.\nSamm Neiland influenced me in two ways in this piece. The first being the continuation of the accent pattern through the middle sections. I personally really enjoy the piece more because of it. It makes it really interesting because it brings so many different time signatures against each other. The melody is sporadically flipping between 7/8 and 2/4 while the accent pattern is mostly in 5/8. They don't quite match up either but I fix the problem with a few filler measures with the pulse.\nAfter the middle themes are presented it returns back to the beginning with just the solid accent pattern and the return of the simple trading melody (this time with oboe and bass clarinet). The timpani returns triumphantly afterwards. This time, however, I change it up by immediately jumping back into the strings having the pattern. At this point, the brass and woodwinds are given simple versions of the accent pattern. They all come in at different times creating a really uneven spread. Eventually the upper lines start to contort the line and break into competing dotted rhythms to give a feel of chase. It builds more and more through the ending section up until a sudden cut off.\nThe final addition by Samm was the diminuendo final chord to ease the listener out of the piece!\n<b>Concept</b>\nAs stated earlier, the whole concept is suppose to be giving the terrible fear inducing attack \"Red Miles\" a soundtrack. The attack is devastating and annihilates all in its way. As we all have heard countless times: you can't escape the miles. Originally, there was to be a whole lot more to the piece (multiple movements!). I didn't have anything else in other movements concrete at the time for finalization of Volume 9 so I released the abridged version you have now! Therefore, I like to think of this version as the Diamonds Droog version of the attack. Smaller scale but not any less deudley.\nI originally wanted to name it Red Miles (Abridged) but that ended up falling through. It sounds perfectly fine as is anyways. Eventually though, I would love to completely finish the whole work (I'm talking 5-6 movements, all inspired by RoS).\nThe last section that I described as sounding almost like a chase is purposeful. The concept is that Diamond Droog is releasing the miles upon the universe and the different musical sections are the different scenes of destruction. The final scene where everything becomes hectic is suppose to be Dirk flying through crumbling towers and crazy red death tentacles trying to escape a painful death. The sudden cut off was suppose to be kind of a cliffhanger like \"where did he go???\" but then the final resolution was supposed to sound similar to a big sigh of relief as he narrowly avoids doom.\n<b>Art!</b>\nOriginally, the art was to be done by everyone's favorite person. Because of silly reasons (really silly, the silliest) it didn't end up happening though. I freaking loved the art too. Instead though, we have a panel from the comic. It just so happens to be the panel where the miles are about to wreck shit at the abode of my favorite Alpha character. I didn't know this at the time otherwise I'd never make a reference to such a horrible event :P"

              "Commentary": "<i>Clark Powell:</i>\nBack on Volume 8 I wrote a song called Serenade; the track art for it explains well what the song is about. In a great many ways it was an important song for me. For one, it was the first song I've ever written, by which I mean a short, lyrical work written in a structure including verses and choruses. On top of that the music and the melodies came unusually naturally to me, and it all felt organic and expressive of my situation in life at the time of writing. Serenade is by far the closest emotional connection I have to Homestuck.\nNaturally I wanted to do things properly if I was going to revisit a tune so personally significant. As part of a larger project I was tentatively calling \"cellostuck\" I decided to tackle Serenade and record a version with live cello parts, hopefully bringing rich textures and lyricism to the song to reflect the musical and personal progress I had made since writing the original. It came out beautifully, much more so than the other experiments I had tried with other songs. I called the final mix Requited, implying that the song can be seen from the opposite side.\nConsider Requited the pre-Scratch counterpart to Serenade.\nFor the artwork on this track I asked my chum Dodostad to draw something up. Her style of whimsical, faded character art seemed the perfect match for the song, and she did a magnificent job."

              "Commentary": "<i>James Dever:</i> (composer)\n\n<b>History</b>\n\nThroughout the last year I've been more active on Skype with fellow Homestuck readers and contributors, especially since February when I was added to the (in?)famous Stupid O' Clock chat. What I found out from a lot of them was that quite a lot more people enjoyed my first ever Homestuck track than I expected. Candles and Clockwork was actually pretty popular and multiple people came to me at different times saying I should work on it again with the better programs and talents I've acquired since.\n\nThe outcome was the remake I posted on my Tumblr a few days before the album came out. I posted this in the Volume 9 thread we had, and Albatross Soup offered to work on the track. The outcome is this final version of Candles and Clockwork!\n\n<b>The Music</b>\n\nI put a whole lot of subtle nuances into this piece. The biggest one being something that occurs throughout the piece and in almost every track of Sburb: hemiolas. For non-music folk, a hemiola is when a rhythm does not fit into the measure of music it is in. They are very similar and often function as polyrhythms, another favorite tactic of mine. In this track specifically, you can notice that the piano ostinato is clearly in 4/4. The clarinet and harp however, are in 3/4. Because of this, these lines only ever match up ever three measures for the piano and every four measures for the other instruments. Since the phrases don't fit that pattern either, the actual lines never quite sync back up and repeat themselves. The melody line above it is for the most part in 4/4 but kind of sways the line between the two time signatures. This is also how I was able to adapt the melody into straight 3/4 for Chronicles (from Sburb) since that version does not have the 4/4 ostinato until the second section!\n\nFor this version, Albatross reorchestrated the parts and added his own distinct flare to the piece. The original version had a dulcimer and harp generating the two ostinati in an attempt to generate a similar feel to the Kingdom of Zeal theme Corridors of Time from the video game Chrono Trigger. The remake I made changed the dulcimer for a harpsichord to change up the timbre slightly. The biggest change was moving the melodies first instance to cello. Albatross took this concept and took it further! The harpsichord became a piano line reminiscent of Chronicles and Candles and Merry Gentlemen (a bonus track from the Holiday album). The harp stays, but the lower voice doubling the part now became a clarinet. A flute is added at the vocal breakdown midway through the piece and then takes over the cello for the recap of the main melody! The ending also became a general diminuendo much like the original! I absolutely adore his take on the song.\n\n<b>Concept</b>\n\nThe original song was written at first in an attempt to go along with Doctor and Endless Climb as a calm and atmospheric song aimed at being a land theme for Dave. At the time we knew him as a knight and WV's painting showed his planet with a large gear and fire. I figured from this that his land would involve something knightly/fire based and something involving gears. From that I guessed it'd be the Land of Candles and Clockwork. Little did I know that Andrew was going to break the chain and pick a vastly different song with Atomyk Ebonpyre.\n\nEver since I've considered the song to be a Strider anthem. Dave and Dirk have a whole lot of songs about them, but all of them are either derivatives of his instrument (inspiring hip hop beats etc) or just really intense. They both are actually really chill and collected for the most part, so I liked the idea of them having a calm song.\n\nAs for this name in particular, it should be obvious that it's the post scratch version of the song (so aimed more at Dirk and Alpha Dave). The working title was also Candles and Clockwork (with the a's replaced with lower case alpha symbols). Sadly, it doesn't really differentiate itself from the original. The symbols aren't separate enough to make it easy to tell the two versions apart.\n\n<b>Art!</b>\n\nThe art was done by the fantastic Worthikids who I only just recently discovered! They actually made it a while ago for the original Volume 5 version. I messaged them about using it for this version. Go check them out!\n\n<i>Worthikids:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://worthikids.tumblr.com/post/22111816772/i-wanted-to-make-something-for-candles-and))\n\nI wanted to make something for [[Candles and Clockwork]],\n\nBecause it’s really an awesome song, and if you haven’t heard it,\n\nLISSTENN RIGHTT NAAOOO.\n\nSoyeah.\n\nDave was drawn in SAI\n\nThe lazily modeled background was made in Blender.\n\n<b><s>WITH HEAVY BURN FILTERING.</s></b>\n\n<small>#HEAVY BURN FILTER</small>\n\n<i>Worthikids:</i> (track artist, [Tumblr](https://worthikids.tumblr.com/post/22141399172/messy-gif-version-the-texture-doesnt-loop), alternate artwork)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/candles-and-clockwork-alpha-version-bonus.gif\" width=\"300\">\n\nMessy gif version.\n\nThe texture doesn’t loop properly.\n\nBut I didn’t save the .blend file.\n\nSo.

Tried to keep in the spirit of the first version w/ old jazz covers here because a lot of them are gritty black and white photographs of guys playing a saxophone with a simple colour wash. Think it looks ok for a plan B??"

              "Commentary": "<i>David Ellis:</i>\n\nThis tune got some pretty cool art from [[artist:kendle-iulus]]. I don't really know anything other than 'wow, that's really cool'.\n\nSo let's talk about the track. I said a little bit about it when I posted it but I thought I'd expand a little.\n\nThe piece is written for the Alpha kids' version of Jack Noir, in particular his attempted jailbreak. Unsurprisingly then every guitar stab is supposed to represent Jack stabbing something. In the original version there were actually more stabs at the start that got cut fairly late in the process because while more stabbing probably suits the character it made the intro feel too long.\n\nAs the tune is for a Jack I thought his piece should be based on the [[Black]] theme. I'd been thinking about doing a take on it for a while but hadn't figured out how I would do it until the jailbreak scene started. At the same time I'd been struggling to write the verse for the Jane song (I have that bit now but I'm still working on the song) so taking a break from that to play a lot of angry distorted guitars also seemed like a good idea.\n\nThe guitar solo is really hard to play.\n\nOriginally it was just going to be a fairly loose guitar jam over the chords from [[track:upward-movement-dave-owns|Upward Movement]] but while that was a lot of fun for me to play it turned out it wasn't that much fun to listen to so I figured it was going to need some more backings. This led to the inclusion of a number of themes from [[Descend]] building up and then a little interplay in the strings at the end. Unfortunately this meant a loose jam style solo wasn't going to cut it anymore so I sat and wrote out the solo you hear now. I threw in a quintuplet and a 5:6 tuplet because apparently I hate writing things I can play.\n\nWhen it was all done I uploaded it, blogged it and then tried to sleep while my phone kept going off until I turned off alerts. I didn't really expect anyone to pick it up but it surprised me by being the most popular thing I've ever posted by a long way (thanks [[artist:toby-fox|Radiation]]!).\n\nThe next day I got a message from Radiation saying he'd like to include it on the album (which turned out to be volume 9). So I went back and tweaked the mix a bit (mainly turning down the gain on the guitars and bringing out the strings in the descend section) and sent him the final wav which is what's on the album. I'm really grateful to be included on the album and I'm glad people seem to like the track.\n\nFun if somewhat nerdy fact: The power down sound that leads into the guitar solo section is actually the sound made when the Hammond organ is switched off while holding down the last chord. The tonewheels inside the organ that generate the pitches start to slow down before the amplifier cuts out so you can hear the pitch lower before the sound stops.\n\nAfter I posted Noirscape it got added to the tracklist for [[album:lofam2|LOFAM2]] and [[artist:straightfacedgriff|straightfacedgriff]] had actually started doing art for it before I had the chance to quietly let them know that it wasn't going to be on the album. The art pretty much sums up the scene the music was meant to be describing at the start though (assuming jack has a few more knives up his sleeve for the other guards) so I thought I'd include it here.\n\n<i>straightfacedgriff:</i> (alternate artwork, for [[album:lofam2]])\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/noirscape.png\" width=\"300\" warning=\"blood\">\n\n<i>Kendle Iulus:</i> ([Tumblr](https://tzepesh.tumblr.com/post/24963148538/album-art-for-noirscape-which-you-can-listen-to))\n\nalbum art for noirscape, which you can listen to [here](https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/noirscape-2)\n\nhere is the reversed side\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/noirscape-reverse.png\" width=\"300\" warning=\"blood\">"

When the concept of the record was changed, it was decided that this relatively short song would be included as a bonus when you purchase the full album.\nThe track art is by Emery Ferguson."

      "Commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\n<center><small>okay first things first</small><br>\nI<br>\nMADE THIS<br>\n<big>FOR YOU</big></center>\n\nYes you. The one sitting at their computer or phone or other gadget, you the one who's doing their hair or putting on flair like you just don't care, you the one sitting at a desk or laying in a bed or even hiding from the cops, I don't really care, this was made for you. It's been worked on over a long period of time (technically almost two years!), it's been delayed and pushed back, it was actually not even going to come out for a while, but here it is. And I'm incredibly thankful that you, whoever you are and whatever your interest, are spending the time to listen to this music.\n\nSo what is this, then? Well, back when the Homestuck music team was all jumping on the concept of \"solo albums\", I said to myself, hum, why not do one? The original concept was incredibly vague, because I'm not a very imaginative person most of the time, an album for John Egbert that used piano in most every track to some degree. And after a few tracks were made, a more specific idea began to emerge, that of an album sequentially examined moments in his journey through SBURB, music for key points or just for scenes. I even graphed the entire (known) timeline out on a giant piece of paper and plotted it all out. It's turned out to be far more ambitious and broad of a goal than I'd originally planned for, especially with how \"key events known\" slowly eclipsed \"key events to unfold\" over time, but I feel confident enough about how this album has turned out that I'm not too worried. And if anything, that means more music has come to you.\n\nNow, before I start rambling at length about the music in here, I've got to toss out a few \"thank you\"s to people.\n\nFirst, to all the artists that helped out with the track art. The stuff that they've all given me is just incredible, and if you ever ask me what my favorite part of this album is I would definitely say \"the art\". I may be biased. There's full versions of all the album art with the album itself, and I'd highly encourage you to give it a look-over and see what else these talented people have put out.\n\nSecond, to the other people in the music team, who've helped me go from \"some guy who uses famitracker and an awful microphone\" to \"somewhat of an okay digital musician\". I'm thankful for every bit of critiquing I've gotten, too, even if I can be really stubborn about it. And all the bros I know in there, if I could meet everyone in person there would be endless fistbumps. You guys rock.\n\nThird, to all the friends and people I've met over the years, through Homestuck and otherwise, that've been great to hang out with and chill with and just talk about stupid random things with.\n\nFourth, to my family for always being around, and for....well, being family. Keeping me alive and healthy and stuff and keeping me from completely failing in this \"life\" thing.\n\nAnd lastly to Andrew Hussie for creating Homestuck, making the really crazy decision to bring me onto the team in the first place, and for giving me the opportunity to both make an album and just make music for him in the first place. I don't know how little I would've composed if I didn't have Homestuck pushing along, both giving me a reason to write and things to write about.\n\nAlright! Now that all that before-album talk is done with, it's time to get into the album proper. I hope you, out there, enjoy this album, and I'll see you on the flipside.\n\n<i>Signed, Erik \"Jit\" Scheele</i>\n\n<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20120818182915/http://www.mspaintadventures.com:80/))\n\nAlbum two of solo month: One Year Older by [[artist:erik-scheele|Erik Scheele]].

And by beginning, I mean \"the morning of 4/13/09, John's birthday and the beginning of it all\". So I wanted to take time with this piece, and create a sort of smooth, shifting landscape, illustrating the sun rising over John's neighborhood before he wakes up. This was mainly achieved by intersparsing little melodic hits on instruments with each other, building up and fading out in turn. The opening from a rather old tune of mine, [[track:light-vol5|\"Light\"]] from Volume 5, also makes an appearance in here to further the overall effect.\n\nI imagine, if this piece were performed live, it would do best with all the instrumentalists scattered to some degree. And I usually hate that gimmick, but it could work well in this context."

              "Commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nNow to completely break away from the previous track, we move into a peppy, small ensemble piece. This one just started out because I wanted a tight ensemble to play something together, something sort of bouncy and light. Before that, I'd been making a lot of pieces that felt unnecessarily large, sticking in instruments for just one little section and not using them the rest of the time, so something lighter with more emphasis on individual parts seemed like a great idea. I had no idea what to call it, though, and it didn't really seem to have much context in terms of the album either, until I was looking through the 2010 calendar that the art team made, and came across the October artwork. Immediately it was like, that was it, the piece both fit the \"kids and fun\" aesthetic that lasted a while in the beginning, and the artwork fit too, so it achieved purpose and title both at the same time.\n\nInstrumentally it fit too, it had piano and bass and bitcrushed drums that sounded somewhat like beatboxing, which were three out of the four instruments the original kids used. There's definitely a discrepancy with using synth vs. violin, though. Before anyone asks, I definitely spent time trying to fandangle string patches into it, but it just didn't work. So you can imagine Rose playing an electric violin, that's what I do. (I don't know if electric violins can function like that string players please don't strangle me thank you)"

Everything's dark, except for the stars above, but as we found out, they were really fireflies trapped in the clouds. This was one of the concepts I latched onto rather hard with this piece, the mass of sparkling and blinking above John as he traipsed about. I've been lucky enough to live in a more rural area for most of my life, and being able to watch the stars was always great, so I could only ever imagine what LOWAS's clouds looked like.\n\nAnyway. I kept the sparkling mainly to the piano, higher register work with some delay making a nice twinkling effect. I'd also just gotten some wonderful \"piano in an attic for 80 years\" samples, which came with a large variety of inner-piano works, like tapping or heavy strokes of the strings, and I sprinkled those rather liberally in places to try and get the effect of thunder. (After all, what sort of lightning storms could a firefly cloud have, anyway?)\n\nAnd of course, there's one or two [[Doctor]] quotes in there just because."

At the time of writing this, that track still hasn't been released, but that didn't stop me from making a cover of it. And then re-making that cover, since the first one was kind of crap.\n\nNot really a whole lot of deep thought or anything with this, I just thought the melody sounded cool and it could work for a sort of high-energy swooping-around sort of thing. And then later, I associated it with John's jetpack flight after he gets warned off from dying to his planet's Denizen, so that's what it became.\n\nOn a completely random note this piece always makes me want to go out running, and I have done so to this piece a few times. If I could do flips and parkour and stuff I'd totally be doing that too cause it works really well. Maybe gunfights too. Alright let's move on to the next piece."

And a little later, I was fortunate enough to get a good recording of it before heading home for the summer.\n\nThe piece itself is meant to go along with John discovering Jade's dead dreamself, after waking up on Skaia for the first time. I know a lot of people associate [[Sarabande]], from Volume 5, with that event, or at least with John reading Jade's letter, but I couldn't help but want to at least touch on it while going through his timeline. Originally I'd stuck this before John even entered the Medium, but that didn't really have any moment tacked on with it, and it made much more sense here."

Basically all you need to know is that there's a car that can fly and it's flying. Like pchooo flying. It's awesome.\n\nFor the piece, I went with this old idea I had a few years back in college, a 13/8 double-piano piece. Seeing as I'm not two piano players, though, I wanted to orchestrate it out a bit, so I put some brighter instruments to double the melody, over top of the original riff, and beefed it up with some light strings and drums. A few other instruments come in later as the piece developed, but like [[October]], I tried to keep it all to a small group and not let the orchestration explode."

It might just be because the Tomb Raider series was a favorite while growing up, but I've always loved old, unexplored ruins, arcane or mystical elements hinted at with wall carvings or murals, that sort of thing. And Skaia, being the center of a sort of central planet to everything in Sburb, could be chock-full of old buildings and mystical secrets to explore.\n\nSo, to try and accompany the general air of mystery and exploration that would have gone with a long journey into the center of Skaia, I took an old idea in Locrian mode. If you're a music person, Locrian is when you take a major scale, but start it on the last note. It's a rather off-kilter scale, and it can't ever really resolve to the tonic chord like most other scales can, which made it rather suited to a piece about the sort of strange secrets and landscapes that could be hidden in the center of Skaia."

It might even be from before I started on the album, I'm not sure. At any rate, when John was stabbed and \"died\" (god tier characters can only truly die from a Just or Heroic death), he stayed dead for a few minutes. And for those few minutes, I imagined that he came to a sort of Game Over screen, or, if you were playing a video game of Homestuck, you would come to a Game Over screen. From there, you could either continue or give up, which is a pretty staple part of game over screens, I think.\n\nAt any rate, the music I went for was to just go along with that, a peaceful song for his demise before he came back. It feels kind of morbid, but since the concept of death has kind of gone out the window and back again in Homestuck, it's hardly as morbid as it could be."

I've held it back from getting released just so it could go on this record, so I'm glad it could finally go out.\n\nThis is also the only piece on the album that doesn't have a specific event to go along with it. Instead, I went for where it appeared in the comic when placing it, and see it as more of a small interlude. The intermission between Act 1 and Act 2 of a musical, if you will. The art is meant to go along with this as well, a sort of non-canon get-together of the first set of trolls and kids we know, and I can imagine them playing this record while they chill.\n\n<i>Killian Ng:</i> ([Tumblr](https://viivus.tumblr.com/post/29518836682/i-was-asked-to-draw-some-things-for-jits-solo), excerpt)\n\nThe art for the ‘unlabelled’ track is like a continuation of [[album:one-year-older|the cover]]. From what I remember [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] told me that all of the other tracks refer directly to John at some point in Homestuck, but this one did not. And it’s kind of in the middle of the album so we put that one down as a kind of 'intermission’ track. And by intermission, we apparently mean party with all the characters taking a break from the plot, enjoying cake and not trying to murder each other. Also, the gramophone’s a reference to the page the track appeared on.\n\nDrawing 16 characters (17 if you include Dad in the back) interacting with each other in a small square while keeping them all recognizable AND still having John as the focal point is hard. Which is why the style’s so different from the cover even though it’s meant to be a continuation - I just couldn’t distinguish all the characters from a thumbnail without the solid, bright colours and cutesy style!\n\nAlso, I hope you all caught my nod to March Eridan in the back there."

At the time, the scratched copy of Sburb was just starting to show some real-world effects by making the \"game\" (aka our viewing experience as an audience) glitch up. So, I set about making some heavier action music for it, incorporating heavy use of weird, messed-up glitching sounds and a few heavy-handed uses of numerical motifs. I also brought in [[Ruins (With Strings)|Ruins]], one of the first piano pieces I ever recorded, the latter section of [[Walk-Stab-Walk (R&E)|Walk-Stab-Walk]], and [[Crystalanthemums]].\n\nOverall, in my opinion at least, the piece turned out a little strange, a little awkward, and not really nice, but really that works just fine for me. Everything was really going for the characters at the time, after all. People were getting hunted down, friends were turning on each other, nobody in the fandom really knew who was going to be next. Was this person? Or this person? Were you next? It all led to a heavy air of unease that sort of manifested itself in the odd piano riff and distorted drums that were used, and all the heavy glitching that led us up to..."

It also served as the inspiration for a project that my third-year piano studio did.\n\nIn the comic, this event was basically a way to reset the universe, everything inside it, and recreate it in a different way, one that would make the game winnable. So, in my head, a mass de-compilation of everything, like a massive maelstrom building as bits of data are pulled apart. A black hole, in other words, but arcing out in waves of energy ilke lightning. Mother Nature ain't got crap on this beast.\n\nThe piece started out as extreme laziness on my part, just idle playing around with various distortion on synths and samples, until the school project came up and wanted results fast. So I threw some things together until they formed the opening, and took a very lax approach to the piano part, a sort of \"here's a riff, now play around with it, there's your part\" with a drum loop over top. Thankfully my laziness didn't extend to the whole thing, and it all got more polished up and developed over time. It still keeps the \"improvised piano part based off one riff\" idea, though."

And, in some games I've played, there's a sort of resting area before the final boss, or a small break to prepare yourself before the last battle. This is what spawned Respit, the idea of a light and airy, calming piece. I was also pretty reminded of Kingdom Heart's usage of the \"resting area\" trope, which was a small chamber with several large crystals around. So, I went with the idea of a large, reflective area, someplace in the dream bubbles perhaps, where the heroes could rest and reflect.\n\nThis is another one of those tracks, too, that tried to predict a future event but was overtaken as time went on. The concept of the dream bubbles and the long voyage John took fit my original idea well enough, though, so that's what the piece molded itself into being."

It pulls from [[Showtime (Original Mix)|Showtime]], the original strife music, and also (ironically enough) from an idea I had when I was around 11 and wanted to make something spooky for Halloween. Let me tell you, it worked way better in this context than my original plan.\n\nSo seeing as this is the final boss fight, there wasn't really any reason to hold back while adding in instruments and layers. To this day, it's definitely the largest piece I've made in instrumentation, and also the first to make me render everything out into separate files because my computer just couldn't handle it. Suffice to say, it's a pretty large piece, for a pretty large fight. There's a rather intentional and large nod to the aesthetic in [[Rex Duodecim Angelus]] by Malcolm Brown as well, since his piece was about the trolls' final fight with the Black King at the end of their session.\n\nAnd at the end, there's a little victory music to pass through and segue into the last piece..."

              "Commentary": "<i>Erik Scheele:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nWay back, before I was even on the team and before I thought I even belonged on the team, I recorded a simple piano refrain. First thing I'd ever recorded, too, and I want to say it was done a few months after Homestuck had started. In my head, it fit in as a possible refrain for one of the characters, and the idea always stuck in my head that it could also work as a piece for the very ending for Homestuck, a sort of \"all is well\" refrain. After two years, I was finally able to make something like what I was thinking and put it in the right context.\n\nLike the [[Homestuck Anthem]], I went with using the four kids' instruments: piano, strings, drums/percussion, and bass, and stuck mainly with those. I also got some help by Mr. Lake of Awesome Beats Inc. who was way better at beats than I am, and he made it way better too. Big props to him.\n\nWith the new universe and many new characters being explored, this piece might not work for \"the end of Homestuck\" anymore, but if anything, I see it as a sort of moving forward. John's journey on that one day, when he turned 13, matured both him and his friends. Like many others, he took the hero's journey, and grew as a result of it, and so this piece could very well fit him leaving his universe and going on to the next, bringing his experiences and knowledge with him, just as well as it could fit him moving past Sburb to whatever adventures lie ahead."

I mean, all the kids had fight music, why not him? Anyway, between a chiptune variant I started and Trollcops, it's had a bit of a journey, but when it turned out alright on piano too, I didn't see any reason not to record a few takes.\n\nLet me just put this out here, I'm not a jazz pianist at all, nor is this really jazz. Not very complicated jazz, at any rate. I know there's way better jazz playing out there, and probably quite a few pianists that'll be wondering why some pianist douchebag thinks he can play jazz, well rest assured, I'm not claiming I'm amazing at all.\n\nOf course, not being able to play something magnificently and to the best form of the genre didn't really stop me from playing around with this piece. So I did.\n\nI also think it would fit in during the first Intermission, with all the under-the-hat chicanery and stabbings that went on."

      "Commentary": "<i>Andrew Hussie:</i> ([MSPA news post](https://web.archive.org/web/20121103151802/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/))\n\n[[album:symphony-impossible-to-play|Remember solo album month?]] There was one last album that was delayed, causing solo month to swell to the size of three months, like the mighty blowsack of an enormous frog. (That is a totally random comparison.) Anyway, without further delay, here it is.\n\nGenesis Frog contains of a series of orchestral pieces by [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti]], who was responsible for such Homestuck tracks as the [[track:squiddles|Squiddles Theme]], and the most important song in Homestuck, [[track:horschestra|Horsechestra]].\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20121026013704/https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/genesis-frog))\n\nComposed and arranged by [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alexander Rosetti]]\n\nCover art by [[artist:sylladexter|Marina]]\n\nTrack art by [[artist:sylladexter|Marina]] and [[artist:rikuru]]\n\n[[track:pondsquatter-live-chamber-version|[BONUS] Pondsquatter (Live Chamber Version)]] performed by [[artist:talea-ensemble]]\n\n<i>Alex Rosetti:</i> (booklet commentary)\nI'm uploading the commentary for Genesis Frog as text for those of you who could not buy my album but were interested in a composer's thoughts and detailed descriptions on its concept and execution. This is Part 1 of 4. If you like the album I encourage you to purchase it if you are able, as it helps support me and it will be that much easier to bring you more music in the future!\n<hr>\nI, Alex Rosetti, intend to make this a pleasurable experience for those of you looking for additional insight on the long-winded and self-absorbed music of this album. I assure you the commentary will encapsulate those qualities as well, perhaps even more so!\nSo, what's this all about?\nGenesis Frog is an album about the eponymous amphibian's journey from paradox slime to universe. Specifically, it is about the frog Jade Harley attempts to breed and grow so that He may reach His pond in Skaia and fulfill His role as the next universe created by SBURB. Some themes of the album also address the Genesis Frog that Earth already inhabits, while still other themes could be applied to any Genesis Frog in paradox space. In more general terms, it is an album about Sburb's mythology, which is both and remarkable and hilariously ridiculous in its ability to tailor fit itself into each unique session it is in.\nWhen I first envisioned Genesis Frog, I did not imagine the album's focus would be on a single entity from Homestuck. In fact, my first idea was to create a sort of \"Homestuck Bestiary\" soundtrack, giving themes to all the creatures and citizens of Sburb. The seeds of the album's current form were planted when I decided I wanted to make a \"Frogs\" theme at the beginning and transform it into \"Bilious Slick's Theme\" by the end of the album, thus symbolizing the overarching purpose of Sburb. I gradually fell more in love with the concept while more information on the Genesis Frog was covered in the story such as frog breeding, the Prospitians' and Consorts' worship of the deity, and Derse's detestation of it.\nI began to realize how important the Genesis Frog was to Homestuck's big picture: the goal of Sburb is creation, and the main conflict in the story is preventing destruction. The most intensely cinematic End of Act as of this writing involved the assassination of two of these frogs as the result of a beautifully intricate plot and pushing the story towards its climax. One of my favorite aspects of Homestuck is its world-building (in some cases world-destroying), and I thought it would be fun to compose an album about an entity that quite literally contains its worlds.\nAlright already, I get it, but what about the music?\nFrom the very beginning I decided I wanted Genesis Frog to have its own unified sound, even back when it was \"Homestuck Bestiary\". To accomplish this, I treated the album as a sort of orchestral suite, and it could certainly be referred to as such. Of course, getting a real orchestra to record this music is well beyond my means as an amateur composer, but I think the samples used in the album are high-fidelity and well-sequenced enough to be enjoyable.\nThere is a lot of continuity between tracks on the album, which lends itself well to the idea that it is an orchestral suite. Genesis Frog is really a singular work rather than a collection of somewhat related songs—I paid very special attention to the order of tracks and when certain recurring themes appear. The album has three main recurring musical motifs: the \"Pondsquatter\" theme (the main theme of the album and most frequently used), the \"Divine\" theme (which first shows up in Our Glorious Speaker), and the \"Folklore\" theme (which first shows up in Prospitian Folklore).\nThere are also a handful of musical devices and ostinati that find their way into various nooks and crannies that help contribute a sense of unity and are certainly fun to spot if you pay attention. I like to think all these snippets of musical material are treated the same way that repeated dialogue, situations and every other kind of callback are in Homestuck. If you recognize them you will enjoy the experience that much more, though the callbacks in the album are not that difficult to spot in my opinion, so it shouldn't take as much effort as noticing Colonel Sassacre's Daunting Text of Magical Frivolity and Practical Japery was heavy enough to kill a cat, and then finally doing so several thousand pages later.\nWhile the album does deviate somewhat from the orchestral sound in a few small instances, the instrumental ensemble remains relatively constant through each track, with the exception of percussion instruments that come and go and a short appearance by an electric guitar and bass, as well some much more eccentric instruments than those.\n<hr>\n<b>Some final thoughts, thank you's, and croaks of acknowledgement</b>\nWow, did I really make it through the entire commentary without typing the word \"ribbit\"? Those of you who know me and my love for animal-based onomatopoeia are probably as shocked as I am. Perhaps more shocking is that I composed an entire album and only included two tracks with ribbits and croaks in them. And one of them is a bonus track, it's a new personal record of some kind! Of course you shouldn't expect me not to put animal noises in any album I ever compose, so don't even go there. Alright, enough of that.\nI would like thank everyone who took the time to listen to Genesis Frog. The fact that I have an audience at all is something to be thankful for, and even if you didn't enjoy it I appreciate you giving it a chance. Thank you to everyone anticipating the album for all their patience and support in the time before its release. Unfortunately I wasn't ready to release it before the Homestuck Kickstarter happened, so it had to be delayed quite a bit. However, I believe the album is all the better for the extra time I had to work on it. Thanks to everyone on the MSPA Forums who voiced their excitement in the Homestuck music thread, or otherwise interacted with me or gave me advice of any kind. Thanks to all my Tumblr and Twitter followers for actually caring enough about what I have to say to follow me. I hope everyone who knows me or pays attention to what I do musically enjoyed this album, as well as people who were not familiar with me until now. I appreciate every single listener I have, and without you guys the only person listening to my music would be my mom and close friends, and somehow that doesn't have the same sense of accomplishment to it.\nI have two very big thanks reserved for my two artists and collaborators, Marina and Rikuru. In a lot of ways this was a joint project, and their art is just as important to the album as the music. From the beginning I decided I wanted the album to be as unified visually as it is aurally, so I tried contacting two artists who were friends with each other and were capable of drawing in a unified style together. As it turned out I could not have made a better decision. Both Marina and Rikuru have knocked every piece of track art out the park the instant I saw them. Their artistic vision matched mine perfectly, and I truly feel that each piece of art they made was a faithful visual interpretation of my music in terms of color, tone, style and pretty much anything you could think of.\nThe three of us tossed around ideas a lot; I looked at sketches, I explained what each piece of music was about, the feelings the music conveyed were discussed. Amazingly the two of them were able to produce all the art necessary for the album and we didn't end up needing any outside help. One of this album's greatest strengths is definitely its unity, and working closely Marina and Rikuru ended up with a product I think we can all be proud of. Thanks so much for all your hard work, both of you. The album is that much better thanks to your artistic visions, and I hope you had just as much fun as I did working on it.\nYou can find the work of the artists here:\nMarina - [sylladexter.tumblr.com](https://sylladexter.tumblr.com/)<br>Rikuru - [quipster-rikuru.tumblr.com](https://quipster-rikuru.tumblr.com/)\nI would also like to thank Toby \"Radiation\" Fox for being a constant friend and getting this album up and running. He's always been a source of inspiration for me whether he knows it or not, and every time he's given his input on my music it has helped me. Kudos to him taking care of so much business on behalf on the Homestuck music team and finding talented musicians in the community to help showcase their music in addition to the \"official\" (pfffahahaha) team's.\nOf course I would like to make an obligatory thank you to Andrew Hussie for creating Homestuck, the entirety of which inspired this album (even the bits of it that don't have frogs). Without his story I wouldn't have had the opportunity to grow and interact with similar-minded musicians the way I have. And without his permission, I certainly wouldn't have this album to show for myself.\nGenesis Frog has undergone quite the journey over the last couple of years, even if the larger portion of it took place inside my head as vague bubbles of inspiration. I was finally able to compose the music I had always wanted to compose and contribute my own voice and interpretation of Homestuck to its discography. This is an immense privilege and one I will always carry in my mind as one of the most important opportunities I ever had in my life. It's an excellent time to be making music, and I will take everything I have learned in making this album with me as I continue to compose in the future. Thank you once again for listening, and make that a double thank you if you read through this extremely long-winded commentary.\nI am Alex Rosetti and I am a composer who loves video game music, whether it is listening to it, studying it, or making it.

The piece opens with a quartal chord in the harp, and after the atmosphere is established a solo clarinet introduces the main theme of the album.  A portion of the orchestra comes in after that and there's a small swell before tapering off into a cello solo. The ensemble is pretty scarce in this one due to its subdued nature. There's not a lot going on in this track overall, but it does its job both as the prelude to Pondsquatter and the album as a whole."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nIf Genesis Frog were a game, this would play at the title screen. It is a full realization of the album's main theme, this time with the entire orchestra in tow and plenty of thematic development. I sort of have a love-hate relationship with this track. For one thing, it is the first piece I composed for the album and its melodic material served as its main groundwork, so it's really important in that respect. But at the same time I had the least experience while initially composing it as compared the album's other tracks, so I had to spend a lot of extra time fine-tuning it and developing it more (the original was barely under two minutes long). Still, considering the amount of work I had to put into it, it was one of the more rewarding tracks to work on.\nThe combination of Prelude and Pondsquatter to open the album with is something I thought about a lot, and in many ways they are one piece split into two parts. Consider this Movement II. Pondsquatter flows right out of Prelude and gradually adds to the orchestration. After a brief celesta interlude, the theme gets going in full. This piece has a sense of emerging, particularly out of the empty space of Prelude. There are plenty of woodwind trills and harp runs; I wanted them to feel like they were bursting out of the texture, and the openness of the quartal harmonies was eventually replaced by more triadic chords. Quartal chords retain some significance through the album, however, though they are certainly not prominent. I aimed to make the climax of this piece very satisfying, with the gong practically screaming \"we've arrived!\" but I was afraid of having too much of a sense of finality so I didn't give the piece a proper ending. Instead it goes straight into the next track without only a hint at a cadence."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nMuch like Pondsquatter, the concept for this piece was conceived very early on in the album's life before it became Genesis Frog. It was supposed to be a theme for the Prospitians, and it still mostly is, but now the piece focuses more on their devotion to the Speaker than the citizens themselves. The chess-people of Prospit are referenced a few times in Homestuck as worshipping the Genesis Frog, and it is through perusing their lore in various updates (mostly Seer: Descend) that I got inspiration for several tracks on the album, including this one.\nThe music was representing devotion, so I wanted it to have the warmest, most tranquil tone it could. There are two chorale-like sections, the first being the passage the strings play in the beginning, and then later in the brass when the rest of the orchestra drops out for a while. The style of this piece was inspired by Taku Iwasaki's scores, which often feature very beautiful and lush string textures. I actually don't think I captured that very well, and in fact strayed from that idea as the piece went on. But the core of the inspiration remains and I think one can tell if they are familiar with his style. Of note is the last third of the piece which is a self-indulgent, overly-romanticized arrangement of Erik Scheele's Sarabande. It's such a beautiful piece and I knew from the day I started working on this that I wanted to include it, no matter how schmaltzy I made it sound. Give me a break, it was fun, okay?"

At last in Skaia's reflection through broken glass He may find the pond in which He's meant to squat.\" – Book in Prospit Library (from Seer: Descend)\nThis piece is a musical retelling of the above passage. If you read it while listening to the music, the tone should match for the most part (as long as you are reading very, very slowly). This track's melody appears several more times throughout the album, and represents the \"folk tale\" and more legendary aspects of the Genesis Frog as seen through His followers. Because of this I tried to make it sound like a genuine folk tune, and ended up with something vaguely resembling a tune out of Eastern Europe. It's a melancholic sort of melody, which suits the grim tone of the text it is based on. It is passed through several instruments: first a solo oboe, then the violins, a soprano recorder, and a trumpet.\nAfter the main section is over, the piece shifts into a short woodwind chorale, and then into what I can only call a cadenza made up of tense suspended figures in the strings with an out-of-meter pulse underneath. I kind of wrote this last section accidentally, since it somehow started flowing out of the chorale and I just went with it. It seemed to have an air of urgency and importance to me, so I kept it in to represent \"Skaia's reflection through broken glass\", which is such a fascinating image. Broken glass has been a recurring motif in Homestuck and seems to hold important consequences every time it occurs, and the text implies it will be significant in the Genesis Frog's final destination. So the atmosphere of this final section felt significant and fitting to me."

I decided it would both be fun and shake things up if I composed a theme for each group of Consorts we meet on the kids' four planets during their Sburb session. Represented are the Crocodiles of LOHAC, the Turtles of LOLAR, the Salamanders of LOWAS, and the Iguanas of LOFAF. Some are more characterized than others, but I made do and crafted a unique theme for each of them.\nThe character of the music during this section is a bit different than the rest of the album due to the inherent silliness of the creatures it is representing. The Consorts are all also, for lack of a better word, dumb. The music reflects that too. This intermezzo transitions from the serious tone of the first section of the album into the absurd rom that is about to follow. The idea of including two intermezzos in this album came from the Actraiser Symphonic Suite, a collection of orchestrations from the SNES game Actraiser that used this classic \"in between\" sort of music as a way to reiterate a recurring theme. I use these little movements in a slightly different manner, but the spirit is the same. Musically, this is a simple interlude that states all the Consort themes that are to come in a solo viola accompanied by pizzicato strings."

This is one of my favorite tracks that I've made, and by that I mean to say I'm really amused I was able to come up with this in the first place. It originally wasn't part of this album at all—it was supposed to be a short jingle for the LOHAC Stock Exchange! But it was too much fun to let go of and soon it morphed into a full-fledged character theme for everyone's beloved, excitable consorts. The general idea behind the music was this: Jit may have made a silly arrangement of Atomyk Ebonpyre, but what could I do to put it in an even more ridiculous context? And so it was that it became the manic violin and xylophone old-timey television music-inspired (this was my only frame of reference for what I thought stock exchange music should sound like) tune that it is now. And wouldn't you know it, this type of music turned out to fit the personality of the Crocodiles like a crocodile-fitted glove.\nIn terms of pacing, I thought it was crucial to place this as the first Consort track. The first four tracks of the album all range from relatively slow to moderately less slow, so I really needed something to break out. This is the most energetic and fast-paced of the four Consort themes, so for my money it was the best choice to introduce this section of the album and keep interest instead of having too many low-energy tracks in a row. However, this isn't to say I was able to resist the temptation to put a slow middle section into this piece, which provides a little break from all the pandemonium. But more importantly, it set the stage for an incredibly silly idea I had to record a bunch of people nakking like maniacs to sound like the Crocodiles, and then have that gradually crescendo into the last section of the piece.\nIn what is of some note, I tried to feature each of the Kids' instruments in their respective Consort theme. Dave's usual turntable affair was impossible for me to consider for this style of music, though I'm sure some incredibly talented person could have pulled it off. Instead, the piece uses xylophone heavily, since I was operating under the logic that both turntables and xylophones sort of fall under the percussion category? I will admit it's a bit of a stretch.\nI would like to thank the following contributors for lending their beautiful, sonorous voices to this piece of music:\n- nyanface\n- Hayden Lombard\n- Tawawa\n- Rachel Rose Mitchell\n- Thom Rosell\n- Marcy Nabors\n- Kyle Chung\n- Ben Sharrin\n- Max Wright\n- Katie Caldwell"

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis was a difficult one to compose. The Turtles in Homestuck haven't been given much characterization other than the ones quaking in fear of Rose, and even then that characteristic is basically the extent of it. I wondered if it was even worth writing a theme for them, since their importance to the story is minimal; what kind of music would I compose for them, anyway? But in the end I decided if I was going to do a set of Consort pieces I was going to do it right and that meant composing the whole package. There was going to be a cycle of fun, lighthearted pieces on this album regardless of characterization or story relevance.\nUnfortunately, by the time I decided this I had absolutely no musical ideas. I knew I wanted to give the piece a sort of awkward, wooden sound, so I had a pretty good idea of what timbres I needed (wood blocks, marimba, bassoons, etc.). Then I decided to just outright make it as quirky as possible and added a contrabassoon, even giving it the melody at one point, because hey, I might as well have fun with a track where I'm making up 90% of a character interpretation. Violin was included to fit the theme of the Consorts' music matching their kids' instruments. I eventually settled on a tired-sounding little melody, and while it is appropriate it's the not my favorite one I've ever written. You can probably tell too, since it never seems to go anywhere, and when it finally sounds like it is it drops out and a different variation starts playing.\nThe middle section is a very loosely based on the Pondsquatter theme, and the high register marimba interjection makes it obvious in case you didn't pick up on it in the first five notes. This eventually leads back into the main melody of the piece, and a couple sequences later it ends. I wonder how much it shows that I was really short on ideas for this piece. Any time it was playing up the comedy in timing or shifting feel, it felt more like I had no idea what to do and desperately stuck something in so the piece could move on. Maybe I'm being hard on it; I still think it is enjoyable to listen to. But from a compositional standpoint, it is probably the weakest on the album."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis piece picks up where Buy NAK Sell DOOF left off, meaning it goes right back into a silly, dimwitted march. This time however, we are joined by John's signature instrument, the electric organ! I also put some piano in there I guess, but baby, it is all about that organ. Maybe it gives it a bit too much of a \"baseball flavor\" but that's okay, the Salamanders are sporting folks. Right off the \"bat\", you will notice the opening ostinato bears a strong resemblance to Danny Elfman tomfoolery, which is entirely coincidental; not that I have any problems with Danny Elfman tomfoolery, in fact I enjoy it very much.\nLike the Crocodiles, the Salamanders have gotten plenty of characterization in Homestuck, so it was pretty easy to write their theme. They actually have a lot in common with the Crocodiles (mostly that they are enthusiastically unintelligent), which is why I decided to give them the same kind of style. There is a primary theme and a secondary theme, and they are both developed throughout the course of the piece. I realize this is an incredibly simple and non-specific description, but it is a very straightforward piece in that regard, and I don't know what else to say about it. The first theme is a bouncy little tune, and the second theme is more legato and chromatic, and they fit together in various ways when they interact with each other.\nI sort of envisioned this composition as a dual piano/organ concerto in terms of how I treated the instruments. Both are featured over the orchestra, and play off it with plenty of silly textures and orchestrations. Stylistically, the oom-pah marching characteristics combined with the instrumentation may call to mind images of a circus, which is in fact how the piece got its name. It's kind of a veiled reference, but if you know what the title is referring to then it's easy to figure out why it resembles circus music. And of course in the spirit of things, for one last antic I finished it off with a slide whistle; an instrument I thought represented the salamanders' bubbles pretty well."

Ever since the Iguanas were introduced I was terrified someone was going to use this pun before I had a chance to put it out in an official capacity. I wanted to be the thip king, and despite being nervous about it for almost two years no one usurped my throne. Even as of this writing, searching for that exact phrase on the internet will yield no results. Obviously if you are reading this, that is no longer true. But I digress.\nAs for the piece itself, I decided to separate it into two very distinct sections. The first depicts the Iguanas' life in the Land of Frost and Frogs before Jade stokes the Forge (which, incidentally, is the name of a later track which takes this concept even further); the second part depicts their life after the frost has melted away. Due to this structure, the first third of the piece is subdued and establishes a calm atmosphere with the strings and woodwinds, with not a single brass instrument to be found. The opening motive that continues to be used throughout the piece is an almost exact repetition of the Salamanders' main motive. All the Consort tracks are connected, but these two take it to the next level by building this piece's base off the main material of the last.\nThe second part is where things get interesting. It is the only section of the album where I drop the orchestra shtick completely and use an ensemble of recorders, crumhorns, pipes, and an unconventional rhythm section featuring a dulcimer. I thought about what kind of music the Iguanas would make if given the opportunity. I figured they would have a lot of primitive instruments at hand and would produce simple, joyous music. This whole section is unabashedly a tribute to Kumi Tanioka's work in Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles. It's a sort of re-imagining of this world of ancient instruments that she created, and it was one of my earliest influences. There are also seeds of Yasunori Mitsuda in here; it is such a fun piece that I don't mind citing very strong influences here if people want to hear similar music to this."

The sequence of tracks was very carefully chosen for this album, and it is especially true here. Every track from here on out details the journey undertaken to create the Genesis Frog, as well as its ultimate fate. From the ectobiological breeding (Breeding Duties), to the unfreezing of the Land of Frost and Frogs (Stoke the Forge), to the hunt for frogs (Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009), to the mysteries and certain doom hiding in the frog temple (The Temple's Withered Bloom), and finally to the destruction of the universe (Bilious), a story is told through music. As a conclusion, we bear witness to the fate the Genesis Frog is meant to fulfill: finding His pond in Skaia (Speaker), and signifying the creation of a new universe (The Vast Croak).\nThis intermezzo changes the tone from the lighthearted Consort music to something more full of wonder to suit the story to come. It is a simple swell based on the Pondsquatter theme, and once it settles down, the texture becomes very sparse so as to lead into Breeding Duties."

It's a great line, and Jade's dumbfounded reaction is even better. Naturally I wanted this to be an awkward-sounding piece, so in the beginning there is plenty of pizzicato strings, strange pauses and the like. Of course, more thought went into the mood than that; Jade has a small association with witches, even if it is only in title and costume. The idea that she is the Witch of Space and is dabbling in ectobiology with frogs put a lot of images in my mind, the most obvious connection being a witch's cauldron. How would this type of music sound, exactly? Eventually I settled on the sort of faux-baroque feel mixed in with plenty of silliness, since this is a piece about Jade and frogs, after all. The orchestration is full of fast-decaying timbres like the aforementioned pizzicato and liberal use of harpsichord. I also included celesta since it adds a sort of whimsy to the piece, and it has the added bonus of calling back to the beginning of the album.\nThe main motive is a very baroque sort of device, and I used it that way a little, though I mostly put it in ridiculous contexts. The opening is very stately and lively; what a way to open the last third of the album! But after the first phrase it immediately drops out into a very spacious world, and it is during this section that I explore a variety of colors while playing with the motivic material. Then I prove how short my attention span is because the music goes a lot of places fast after that. First it takes a sweet tone with a celesta melody, and then feels majestic with a lyrical cello line and a call in the horns. If you were to think about this piece programmatically, then that might be the moment when Jade finally successfully breeds the frog with the right genes. In which case the rest of the piece is about hundreds of frogs hopping around or something, which is an explanation I like, but will not officially state since I wasn't actually thinking much about a story when composing this.\nBut still, I did have a lot of scenes brewing in my head with this one, so I think it is totally appropriate to imagine a story going along with it. Anyway, the majestic section cuts off for a few seconds, then a booming section based on the opening stumbles in and leaves as fast as it entered. From that point on the material from Pondsquatter comes in and is given the same feel as the rest of this piece, and if there was any one word I had to describe this last section with it would be, \"shenanigans\". Incidentally, I consider this and Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009 to be the heart of the album. There will be more on that later in the commentary."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nWhy did I compose this piece? Well, mainly because I wanted something bombastic to use an anvil as percussion in. But I also wrote it because of its importance in the role of each Space player's planet and their frog breeding duties. Not only that, but it acts as a transition from the darker Breeding Duties to the lighter, more energetic Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009. More specifically, it extends the idea behind Thip of the Tongue to three tracks instead of one; it is a progression from the planet's frosty beginnings to a sudden and beautiful spring, and this piece heralds that moment. In any case, I ended up with a pretty fun piece that may not be the most impressive on the album, but it definitely serves a purpose and keeps the flow intact.\nThe piece opens with a brass fanfare based off the Folklore theme interspersed with anvil and bass drum hits. The decision to feature the anvil came from Dave's denizen, Hephaestus, who is referred to as \"Lord of the Forge\" with little explanation other than he desired access to Jade's Forge to repair the Caledfwlch. In fact, the entire piece has the feeling of hammering, since harsh gestures in the brass and strings are common in combination with liberal usage of timpani and bass drum. The entire piece is in Dorian, which is a mode I can rarely resist composing in, and it lends a big sense of adventure to it. Formally there is not a lot going on, other than a melody being repeated several times with different orchestration and transposition. An interesting moment occurs when the entire ensemble drops out and a flute solo comes in playing a lighter, more humorous version of the tune before heading towards the climax. All in all, it is a pretty standard theme with a solid tune despite the fact that nothing extraordinary happens for its duration. But hey, we wouldn't want overkill would we? I was saving that for the next track."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\n Ah, frog-hunting music. I had the idea for this track brewing long before Homestuck Volume 8 was in the works, so you can imagine my horror when not one, but two tracks with this subject were on it. I have to give props to Jit and Bowman, those are a couple of great pieces and they both explore the idea in unique ways. I lamented however, worrying my track would be extraneous. How many times could we repeat the same, specific idea, after all? So I had to think outside the box a little bit. I would try to capture the entire experience of not just the hunt, but exploring LOFAF after the Forge had been stoked. This piece is programmatic in the same sense Breeding Duties is—it is meant to be a collection of musical ideas depicting any number of scenes the listener might imagine. Which isn't to say the music isn't thematically grounded; it is essentially based on one theme in addition to the Pondsquatter theme, which also has a large presence.\n Earlier in the commentary for Breeding Duties, I referred to that and this track as being the heart of this album. It may sound hokey, but when I think of Genesis Frog I think of these two tracks. I think they exemplify the kind of music I've had in my head for two years and wanted to compose most. When I first thought of them, I knew Genesis Frog as an album would work, this was the kind of music I had always wanted to listen to but no one had quite made yet. This isn't to say it's anything new or innovative; merely that it is a specific sound I love that I wanted to hear. I think the album experience is purest during these two tracks, as ridiculous or pretentious as that may sound, but I don't know how else to say it. Great LOFAF Expedition of 2009 is made up of so many of my favorite things to do in orchestral music, so for better or worse you can use this as a roadmap for my compositional output and ridicule me as I become more and more of a slave to my own style.\n It opens with a solo horn call to signify the beginning of the hunt. Normally these sorts of calls are based around perfect fifths, but I totally broke the rules like the rebel I am and used it as a way to introduce the main theme. After that, the piece is split into three sections, the first being a march featuring a piccolo playing a variation on the Pondsquatter theme. The orchestration gradually fills in, and an ostinato is introduced in the xylophone and santoor (a string instrument native to India) that is used throughout the piece. After the march, we dive into the undergrowth, represented by the next section.\n The music makes a shift into 7/8, though no true pulse is really established. As a result, many different lines of counterpoint come in at disjointed intervals, lending to the image of a lot of different frogs hopping around in the depths of the forest. The pace picks up again when the music shifts back to simple meter and the march rhythm is brought back. There is more counterpoint here with the main motive of the piece; it is overlayed with itself in several different rhythmic rhythmic transpositions over the march ostinato. Then, after a brief interlude, the piece shifts back into 7/8 with more of a pulse, and the Pondsquatter theme is repeated in full followed by a coda based on this piece's motive. This is one of the few pieces on the album that ends on an unambiguous tonic chord, which I thought was very refreshing at this point. Especially in light of this piece, which I promised would be overkill thanks to all the ridiculous directions it manages to go in for its duration of five minutes."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nThis is an interesting one, since it has probably undergone the most change in terms of concept and musical ideas before I finally composed it in earnest. It started out as a general Frog Temple theme, and all along I had the idea to explore sweeping chords in the strings and choir, which I did end up doing, albeit in a very different fashion than I expected. I tossed around the idea of including material from Jit's Ruins, then I thought about adapting an old wind ensemble piece of mine. Conceptually I switched from the idea of the Frog Temple to the hieroglyphics inside, tentatively naming it \"Temple Walls\", then \"Glyphs\".\nWhat ended up happening was that I ended up composing this and the next track as one whole, and then split them into two, so in a lot of ways the two of them combined could be considered a single piece. In fact, I would venture to say the last four tracks on the album could be considered four connected movements among the greater whole, since I added more continuity between them than any previous tracks on the album. Because of the connection to the last track, which is heavily about Jack Noir, I decided to have this music represent the Lotus Time Capsule he went through during Cascade. The lotus being in the frog temple was very convenient for me since I got to keep that idea without straying too much from the theme of the album. So this track ended up being the calm before the storm as it were, representing the menace hiding inside the temple for centuries before coming out to wreak havoc.\nThe piece opens with a major chord in the strings, as if to continue the train of thought left behind by the previous track's end. However, the chord quickly changes into something more dissonant, and the tone shifts from light to dark. The choir answers the strings, and the piece progresses in this manner with the two sections being featured the most. A gamelan ensemble plays in the background, very out of tune with the rest of the ensemble, lending to the sense of foreboding. There is a musical device in here that represents Jack, a descending line that implies a tritone. It comes in quietly and at irregular intervals, indicative of the murderous asshole lying in wait among the confines of the temple. As the music progresses, this motive comes in more and more until it is an ostinato under the chordal strings and choir. Eventually the piece crescendos and leads into the next track, where Jack is finally the star of the show."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nPoor Bilious Slick. Every iteration of Him we've seen in Homestuck has been brutally murdered in one way or another. As if that wasn't enough, He is primarily known by the spiteful nickname Dersites have given Him. In composing this album, I would have missed a big opportunity if I didn't take material from those in Derse that oppose creation, most specifically Jack Noir. The title of course came from the name Bilious Slick, but it also has the benefit of adding grotesque imagery to a piece of music about Jack slaughtering a giant universe frog. It is a continuation of The Temple's Withered Bloom, and it picks up where it left off with Jack exiting the Lotus Capsule, escaping the session and eventually going on to destroy the universe he emerged from.\nThe piece opens right away in 10/8, and an electric guitar, bass, and drum set are added to the ensemble. I decided that among the pastoral and bouncy, lighthearted pieces in this album, there was no single track that felt like a hook to me. I wanted to attempt to compose something that just plain kicks ass, some climactic piece that could act as a reward for listening through the relatively calm album. Naturally I came to the decision to include guitar and drums and let more rock influence come through.\nThe theme is based on the Folklore theme, which I thought was appropriate and somewhat ironic, since what represented creation before was now being used to represent destruction. The guitar takes over the melody as the meter goes through several changes, and after several consecutive contrasting sections that play with different motives, the guitar once again begins the next section by establishing a triplet ostinato.\nAt this point I figured, what the hell, I'll quote Black. It actually fits quite well with the \"Jack\" device from The Temple's Withered Bloom that I bring back here, thanks to the fact that they both emphasise on the tritone. My own Jack motive begins to take over from Radiation's, and eventually the strings are playing it in canon as it gets more and more chaotic, until everything drops out and the lower piano register begins an ostinato based on it. The orchestra builds again into more chaotic textures, the tension drops briefly, and then the theme is recapped as the climax. All in all it is probably the most exciting piece on the album, and for my first foray into more action-like music, I think it does its job well."

The nothingness persists for a bit, a result of the universe's destruction in the previous track. If I were feeling really dark I could just end the album there, but I wanted there to be a sense of conclusion and returning to what once was. What better way than to have the music rise from the ashes and the solo clarinet come back to play a new version of the Pondsquatter theme? The idea behind the countless Genesis Frogs is that they propagate one another, each frog producing the next, and behind this lies the idea of infinity and repeated processes. So I wanted the album to do a Mobius Double Reacharound as it were, and end as it began. So the pairing of Speaker and The Vast Croak echoes the earlier pairing of Prelude and Pondsquatter.\nThis piece even has the same structure and general idea as Prelude before going into a full statement of the modified theme. As a result it is difficult to talk about its composition, since it is virtually the same as Prelude only with varying material. The clarinet emerges out of the atmosphere just as before, and a texture-based section builds this time not into a false climax, but into a fuller orchestration of what the clarinet was doing earlier. It ends simply and quietly in the woodwinds, allowing the next and final track to proceed with its exciting start."

              "Commentary": "<i>Alex Rosetti:</i>\nAfter six notes from the drumset, the grand finale begins. I still don't have a clear idea what prompted this sort of conclusion to the album. For the longest time I intended to end it the way Speaker did, and that track indeed had a finality of its own. But I wanted something exciting at the end, and I felt like there was still momentum left over from Bilious that I could do something with. So despite only having a vague idea of what the Vast Croak probably was at the time of this composing it, I ran with my assumptions and based the album's last hurrah around that idea. What little information existed implied the Genesis Frog will Croak once He has matured, and I can only assume it signifies the birth of the new universe in some way. I hope my interpretation does not end up conflicting with canon, and even if it does with any luck the music will still match the tone of it and my thoughts will remain hidden in this commentary.\nKanaya described the Vast Croak as the most amazing thing she had ever seen. I doubt anything I compose could possibly match the scope of such a cosmic event, but I at least attempted to capture the excitement of such a thing happening. When one thinks of the Vast Croak being put to music I'm sure bombastic orchestrations come to mind, like bass drum hits and gongs swelling, the brass going wild. Maybe that would have been the right direction to go in. Of all the tracks on this album this one probably puzzles me the most, since I'm not sure exactly why I decided to go in the direction I did musically. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people think it isn't appropriate for its namesake, and maybe someone else could compose something more suitable at some point. All I can say is that I wanted to capture the excitement of the moment and create something that felt like joy spilling forth. I wanted the music to have a big sense of happiness and accomplishment, a feeling of \"yeah, we did it!\" Even if it did not capture the feeling of the Vast Croak in as literal a sense as it could have, the music has the kind of feeling I imagine players would have upon reaching this final, monumental goal. That is my defense, and I am sticking by it.\nThe sense of excitement is what prompted me to bring the drumset back. I thought the piece needed a percussive drive like Bilious had, so I employed the same method. And hell, if I'm going to bring drumset into an orchestral setting then I might as well do it a second time. The Dorian version of the Pondsquatter theme played by the horns and trombones is reminiscent of its use in Prospitian Folklore. In fact, the second phrase appears exactly as it did in that piece and after repeating it goes straight into the Folklore theme. At this point in the music I thought it was appropriate to quote some of the themes from earlier in the album as a sort of \"B\" section. I mixed together all the Consort themes once the Folklore theme ended and snuck in a little bit of Breeding Duties. I liked the idea of bringing all these themes back, since presumably all of them would have a role once again in the new universe being created.\nThe A section then returns in a transposed form before the piece ends in a very big fashion. When all appears to be said and done and the very last of the reverberation is dying off, the harp comes in. It is followed by clarinet, piano, celesta, and finally the violins playing harmonics; this is the instrumentation the album opened with. This small ensemble plays a subdued arrangement of Pondsquatter, and the album ends as it began in the vastness of paradox space. If you start the album over again, you will find that it flows seamlessly from the ending to beginning. Somewhere in this revelation lies my ultimate artistic intent with Genesis Frog, which probably involves something about infinity's endless repetition, or life always finding a way forward, or something along those lines depending on how pretentious you want to think of me as."

I hope people are still enjoying it and continuing to discover little nuances I hid in the music. Thanks so much everyone.\n<hr>\nDuring my Junior year of college, I had the opportunity to have one of my pieces read by the acclaimed Talea Ensemble, a chamber group that was visiting my college and doing a performance there. They graciously offered to read through student works and provide commentary for us. I took advantage of this in an odd way and arranged Pondsquatter for Pierrot Ensemble, an instrumentation that consists of piano, violin, cello, flute, clarinet, and in some cases percussion. This recording was made during a runthrough they did of it, and what you should keep in mind is that this was all sightread. Obviously the performance is not perfect, and I'm slightly afraid of sharing this in case I embarrass the ensemble with it, but I can guarantee that had they prepared it beforehand, it would have been perfect. However, even without prior preparation, the performance is astounding and I thank them dearly.\nIn case you are reading this online and are unable to buy the album to obtain this bonus track, you can find it on both my website and my music blog, the URLs of which are provided at the end of this commentary."

It's still a very fun piece though, and I thought it was worth including as a little bonus. I may have employed heavy use of certain frog-related sound effects...it's a bit of a weakness..."

              "Commentary": "<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\n<b>The Concept</b>\nSo with Cherubim, we tried something a little different to reflect the duality of the character/s in question.  The album would be split into an even number of tracks grouped in pairs, and then finish off with Eternity Served Cold, to represent Caliborn's dominance and unchaining.  The pairs would represent a similar track done in two distinct styles for Calliope and Caliborn - Calliopes tracks would be considerably mellow, light, friendly, while Caliborn's versions would be chaotic and angry.\nCarne Vale mirrors RJ's \"Stellarum Salve\" though only vaguely - I probably could've done a better job, but hopefully there's enough recognizable lapses into SS that I treat as Calliope's personality sorta coming back into the fray.  The noticable sections are 0:00 and 1:58. Outside of that, anything pretty much went - The original ideas thrown about were a kind of crazy, OTT DnB. I ended up combining that with quite a bit of angry metal guitar, and a few spoonfuls of English (And Eternity, just for a bit of foreshadowing).\nOriginally I was looking into the Saw theme for inspiration, since there's quite a lot of decent connections to be had there (Not least because of Caliborn's escape sequence and the whole Lil' Cal thing) - in the end I didn't really use much of this, which is a shame because it'd probably work quite well...\n<b>The Name</b>\nThe name for this guy actually has more backstory than most.  The working title was \"Caliburninate\". Afterwards I thought \"uNCHAINED\" might make a nice name, since the progression of the song made it seem an almost alternative version of Caliborn's freedom/leg-sawing. adventure.  Trouble was, Eternity Served Cold already provided the background to that, and it'd make more sense to rename EsC to \"uNCHAINED\" than this one (as pointed out by Toby).  So that idea was dropped and still no name.\n(Also, while I considered renaming EsC to 'uNCHAINED', I figured that guy'd been renamed enough and people were already referring to it via the 'Eternity' name, so I figured just leave it).\nFinally I looked to the whole ICP/Juggalo angle.  Latched on to the name \"Carnival\", but that on its own was a bit flat, so went looking into the etymology of the word.  Dug up \"Carne Vale\" (lit. 'Farewell Meat') and that was that.\nIt bizarrely managed to be a sort of weird mirror of \"Stellarum Salve\", and be almost appropriate to the whole leg-slicing shenanighens.\n<b>The Track</b>\nNow, there was quite a lot of DmC being played while I was making this, so a lot of of inspiration came from both the new Devil May Cry and the original ones.\nWe start off with a minor-ised version of a sequence from Stellarum Salve, before bursting into the rising power-chord section.  This is you're typical \"transformation\" section where Caliborn's personality is beginning to take over.  Of note for this song is the usage of Shreddage, which I've been fiddling about with after Toby posted about it a while back.  My setup for using it isn't brilliant, but the Amp sim it comes with is decent enough and the recorded strings and general setup (i.e. easy support for double tracking and the like) are probably better than anything I could do with a real guitar.\nAt 0:45 we bring in a direct reference to Eternity/English.  (The melody is English, the music box in the background is referencing the beginning of Eternity). Can't quiet remember what I was doing for the synthy-bass in the background, but I do remember it was fairly distorted.  The laughing here I'll talk about a bit later...\n1:10, and Shreddage is paying for itself with a meaty bit of rhythm guitar.  Probably could've done a bit more variation around these sections, but it was doing a good enough job.\n1:57 gives us the second Stellarum Salve reference, sort've mashed two bits together.  Here we have a brief reprieve from the chaos as Calliope's personality resurfaces.  Then however, we get to the noisiest bit of the whole song.\n2:27 and we get ready to go into full rave mode. Once the beat gets going, I decided to try a more complex riff for shreddage, a mix of power chords and lead. The synth bass also gets a bit more to do, adding a bit of panning and the then pitching it up to play a crazy arpeggiation.  This bit was basically just \"do something crazy\". Originally I had some laughter here too, but took it out since it was being drowned out by everything else.\n3:02 and we return to a bit of sanity.  The guitar solo here is again provided by shreddage and sequenced - It's actually fairly simplistic, but adding a few articulations helps fool it into sounding a bit more believable.\n3:26 and we bring our old friend Fruity Slicer back into the fray.  He's simply slicing the beat that was used throughout the song previously, while the rest of the song calms back down to another reference to English.  Once that's done, we bookend the whole thing with another reference to Stellarum Salve - Caliborn's off back to sleep and we're returning to Calliope again.\nNow, a few other interesting things about this track (That a few people have already spotted) - firstly, it actually uses quite a few samples that come with FL Studio.  Namely the percussion and the laughter.  The percussion was pretty much the only example I had for the kind of drumline I was after, so it was fine.\nThe laughter was an interesting example - It's from one of those collections of samples of voice that are usually terrible and added to 90s dance tracks (Shouting something random if its a male voice, like \"CHECK THIS BASS!!\" or \"YEAH!\" and moaning something incoherent if it's female like \"Oooahhhawoooahhayeah!\".  Pitched up it sounded creepy enough when layered.  It's a bit cliched, but it works.\nAnd that's Carne Vale.  An angry little shout from a little green, malevolent angel-baby. Grr. Argh."

              "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\nI floated the idea for a UU + uu album last year in about June as a concept record divided in half with equal and analogous parts Calliope and Caliborn. While we really wanted to jump in and get to making more Homestuck music following Volume 9, we decided to wait and discover more of the two characters until December when Radiation re-organized the effort. He proposed the Jekyll / Hyde alternating pace of the album culminating in \"Eternity Served Cold\" and had the group split into pairs, each musician working with a partner on a track with the same themes and motifs.\nI worked with Erik, who sent me the at-the-time unfinished Calliope composition \"Constant Confinement\" for me to base my Caliborn track around. Erik's track was so meditative, it was actually difficult to recognize the slow-paced woodwind melody over the course of the piece, which pulses onward without any strict meter. This melody had to be expanded upon a lot to match the pace of \"Constant Conquest\" - it actually flies by at breakneck pace in the first measure of the piece before settling into its groove.\nConquest in many ways resembles [[Ruins Rising]], another electronic track based around one of Erik's piano compositions. Like in my approach to \"Ruins\" I arranged the melody sparsely and created a very dense environment of drums and percussion sounds to convert Erik's pulse into a groove. Same input, same solution, although this time I went much, much heavier than ever before. I had a handful of different drum kits going all at once, each with unique effects chains, to create more of an ensemble sound than a clean dance beat.\nWhat really sealed in the atmosphere of this track was the huge slather of pads that adorned the track, most of which were created using analog equipment. I fed the signal from an old Radio Shack keyboard with basic midi patches through a pawn shop guitar pedal to create the many layers of sound that fill the background. Some of the most excellent sounds on the track (especially that snarling synth at 2:57) were created by hammering the mod knobs and wah-wah pedal while playing atonal pitches. The result is distorted synth excellence."

Brown]]. I told you we had entered [[track:unite-synchronization|the Brown Zone]], but you didn't listen. It's not in an album yet, and won't be for a little while. Not until some time after Solo Album Month, which according to my calendar is happening [[album:symphony-impossible-to-play|REALLY SOON]].\n\n<i>Malcolm Brown:</i>\nFirst off, a thanks to the folk who enjoyed EsC.\nSecondly, the above question's been asked by enough folk now that's worth commenting on. Specifically, a) Will I release the original and b) Why is it different.\nSo let's get a) out of the way: Most likely - I won't release it right now though, as that'd diminish the album release. Somewhere down the line I'll release the original version with the original mixing, and possibly the cut ending part (Which was cut because it sounded silly :p).\nNow for b):\nGetting the first bit out of the way, I've a long way to go with learning mastering properly. What sounds ok on Headphones A might sound too bass heavy on Headphones B, absolutely lightweight on Speakers C and generally terrible on earphones Q. With a bit of effort, understand and the right equipment or software the process can be considerably better (I'm using various Dynamic Range monitors to check loudness, for example). I'm still fairly naff at it.\nNow, Eternity's one of the more complicated tracks I've done - It's got quite a few opposing voices: a synth orchestra, synth and heavy percussion, rhythm and lead guitar voices, pianos, wooden and metal toned percussion, timpanies, creepy sound effects, various choirs with various articulations and so on. Getting all these noises to sound halfway decent on top of each other might've been a bit beyond my current skill.\nWhen I passed the first version to Rad, he noted it was a bit quiet compared to other tracks. A few variations later (Some bass reduction because a lot of my tracks are a bit bass heavy, I blame my default headphones which have very little bass), then it was a bit anemic. Brought the bass back, tried to bring in some of the voices that were being drowned out (This is the biggest problem people have with the newer version - Some of the strings have been reduced in favour of other voices, notably in the Revelawesome section). Long story short, I didn't have a decent setup that lets me make any mastering decisions with much confidence.\nThere's also a few notable mistakes in EsC in general - Firstly, there's simply too much strings. In some sections, there's a high string melody, with staccato strings, more strings below that, and a cello/double bass strings bit. And a solo violin on top of that. It's simply too much string section fighting over control of what's going on - This was the main reason for trying to bring the french horns and oboe back into the fold. Additionally, I'm not convinced I'm using panning to its best, resulting in a very squashed mix that's very central and doesn't sound \"spacial\", which a bit orchestral track really should.\nMastering EsC highlights that there's large gaps in my skill for music production that I need to brush up on. This is good - It's always good to have targets for self improvement. I'll say right now that both versions are still considerably better than Rex Duodecim Angelus :p And essentially it's the same deal - A synth-orchestral romp through a Homestuck medley meant to sound mean and imposing and threatening, so I won't say I'm not improving :D.\nTL:DR: Yes the old version will be released at a later date. It sounds different because I'm wishy-washy at mastering. (I'm not actually sure if I'm using that term right, I'm basing it off Peanuts)\nHope that answers ya'lls questions :)\n([Tumblr](https://dragonxvi.tumblr.com/post/28573051810/eternitys-shylock-a-short-commentary))\n<img src=\"media/misc/04681.gif\" width=\"300\" warning=\"motion warning\">\nI've been getting a lot of questions about this guy, so here goes:\nIt's commentry time!!!\n<b>The track in general</b>\nIf you've been paying attention to this blog, I already hinted at the development of ES.  It's kind of a \"Sequel\" to Rex Duodecim Angelus in that it's a gradual Medley of HS tracks arranged in some kind of sinister Boss Theme.\nThe track itself is split into 3 \"Acts\".  Act I acts as a kind of intro and goes from 0:00 to around 2:30 (As the Revelawesome section begins).  Act 2 is the conflict, and ends just after \" the party is defeated\" and the music turns a bit more sinister around 4:40.  Act 3 is distinctly missing from the flash, but deals with the heroes comeback and eventual final conflict and resolution.  The Flash ends just hope is beginning to peek through.\nThe obvious inspiration and basis for this track is <b>Toby Fox's \"English\"</b> and it's meant to be a track for LE 'imself.  As the act structure implied, it was designed for a battle with LE vs The Good Guys, but ultimately works as a \"LE is doing something incredibly nasty and you guys better stay away!\"\n<b>The track in more detail</b>\nI tried to be a bit more cinematic in my orchestral arrangement here.  It's far from perfect, but it's better than previous attempts.  Gotta keep pushin' yourself I guess.\nStuff you should be able to hear:\n- [[Sburban Countdown]] (At the start and occasionally in other places)\n- [[English]] (Should be obvious)\n- [[Revelawesome]] (ARound 2:40)\n- [[Black Hole / Green Sun]] (Twisted a bit, but after the Revelawesome section. The music box makes it noticeable, and 'English' is playing on top of it)\n- [[Endless Climb]] (Subtly added at 3:37)\n- [[track:ruins|Ruins]] at 4:03\n- [[Penumbra Phantasm]] and hints of the finale of the SotDD section in [[Cascade]] at the end.\nStuff you didn't hear because the track ends before it gets going:\n- [[Doctor]]\n- Quite a bit of guitar\nSo why make another Medley fest? Quite a lot of the HS themes blend really nicely together, and we can associate a lot of events and memories with past flashes (Revelawesome was used as a kind of gag, but here's it more sinister).  I do like a good Medley, and judging from the reaction of Descend, RDA and the latest Solo Album, you guys do too!\nThe track was made in FL Studio. It mostly uses SoundsOnline EWQL VST libraries, namely:\n- Symphonic Orchestra\n- Symphonic Choirs (Shouty choir girls)\n- Goliath (For some of the larger percussion and sound effects)\n- Ministry of Rock (Guitar, some percussion and bass guitar)\nAnd a few soundfonts.\n<b>When is it available?</b>\nGood question! I suspect you'll be waiting for Volume 10 to show up, which'll materialize after the solo albums and once we've got enough Cherubim goodness for you.\n<b>The Name</b>\n\"Eternity's Shylock\" is an odd one I'll grant you.  It's alternative working title is \"Eternity Served Cold\".\n\"Eternity\" should be obvious. He's a time travelling demon after all.  \"Shylock\" is a bit more confusing and that leads us on to...\n<b>A bit of controversy with the name</b>\n\"Shylock\", as many of you know, is a character from \"The Merchant of Venice\".  Specifically, a rather antagonistic Jewish Moneylender.  You can [read all about the antisemitism debate on the WIKI page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice#Shylock_and_the_antisemitism_debate) but long story short, the character of Shylock has quite a bit of controversy surrounding the portrayal of the Jewish.\nNow, from the name \"Shylock\" it's also a slang term for \"Loan Shark\" - One who loans money yet charges extraordinary amounts of interest and threatens those who cannot pay the return.  It was used in 20th century gangster/Mafia slang, and that's where I pulled it from as a nice fit to Lord English.  Therefore \"Eternity's Shylock\" - One who gives time, only to take it back with interest.  It's a bit of a stretch, but in the end it sounded like a nice name - Mildly sinister, yet grand.\nNow, my use of the term \"Shylock\" in this context is that of a Loan-shark. There's been plenty of portrayals of this profession, particularly in crime dramas where one character gets in deep with one and they send round \"The boys\" to break some fingers etc.  The name \"Shylock\" in this manner refers to the profession and behavior rather than the character or his religious beliefs, but I can fully believe why some people would look at the name \"Shylock\" with disgust, given the controversy surrounding him.\nThis was my bad in lack of research, and I apologize.  There was certainly no insult meant if it was received.\nHowever, it should be clear to anyone that Lord English, a time travelling threat to all existence, is not in any way implicated to be Jewish.  No more so than the implication that he's from England and has a seat in the House of Lords because of his name.  He's a green, skeletal Mafia pimp demon who flies through time in a crazy sarcophagus and vomits rainbow laz0rs.\nI may be [mis]understanding the original controversy surrounding the issue, but from what I read it implied that Shylock the character and Lord English were one and the same, and that Homestuck was presenting a parallel to tMoV.  The link is... Well I may not be the finest literary analyst in the world, but I don't buy it in the slightest.  And even if it was a genuinely well thought out analysis, I'd be delighted to be told exactly where in Homestuck it is implied that Lord English identifies himself as Jewish by his words or actions.  Or at which point Shylock vomits lasers all over the dream ghost of Antonio.\nSee, it sounds absurd.  Fan-speculation is a large part of the Homestuck community, but sometimes it can get a bit icky when it dives into issues of race and creed.  You're thinking about it too much, it's a webcomic about some crazy stuff. Just chill.\nhonk HONK."

It's available here on bandcamp. It was originally featured in Clark's album, [[album:symphony-impossible-to-play|Symphony Impossible to Play]].\n\nToday marks exactly seven years from the day Homestuck began. And Act 7's single-page installment marks the end of the story. Seven acts in seven years, to finish a sprawling \"creation myth about kids in houses,\" as I would describe it for those who asked what my next project was about before I started it. What is there to say about this ending? The short and funny answer is, Homestuck has finally completed its long journey over the rainbow, and become the anime it was always meant to be. The longer and less funny answer will need some reflection. Maybe some day I will say some things about it. For now, I will leave you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nThe animation itself had a fairly complicated production history. I actually storyboarded it about four years ago. In fact, some of the shots I visualized before I even began Homestuck. I'd like to extend very special thanks to [[artist:angela-sham|Angela Sham]], who took the reins on the animation while it was in progress, and worked with me closely on it for about a year until it was done. She's a great animator, and I'm quite excited that she's continuing to work with us on the game.\n\nIt probably goes without saying, but ending this story is a personally significant moment as well. I could say more about this too, but I'd rather not fill the news section with too many words today. For now, all that's left to do is express some appreciation. Whether you've been here from the beginning, hopped on board somewhere along the way, or only heard of it last week and made an insane dash through the archive to catch up in time for the conclusion, I mean this sincerely:\n\n<img inline width=\"420\" src=\"media/misc/thanksforplaying.jpg\" alt=\"Thanks for playing.\">\n\nEdit: one more thing. If you're curious about whether there will be anything resembling an epilogue to this ending, yes, I've been thinking about that for some time. It'll take a while to produce though, whatever specific form it ends up taking. Working on [[album:s-collide|Collide]] took months, and came right down to the wire. I've got more time now though obviously. But that said, I'm not in a huge hurry at this point. Keep an eye out here for developments. There should be plenty of other news in coming months too.",

More fantastic music by many familiar names who have contributed to the comic over the years. Thanks to all who came together to make this. It's a great way to cap off an impressive discography, now standing at 27 albums.\n\nSince 4/13 I have been preoccupied with a wide variety of projects. Some are related to Homestuck, some are not. And yet others are not so easy to categorize. I have kept busy, and do not feel there is much to report yet. But there probably will be over the next couple of months. Stay tuned, and please enjoy listening to some very good songs.\n\n<i>Robert J! Lake:</i> (project manager, booklet commentary)\n\n<b>FOREWORD</b>\n\nThis almost didn't happen.\n\nAs of release day, it's been exactly four full years since [[album:homestuck-vol-9|the last numbered Homestuck volume]], with only one full album between then and now.\n\nIn fact, it's now actually been a longer time since the last numbered Homestuck volume than the time between Homestuck beginning and it coming out. That's crazy, right?\n\nCan you believe there was a time when Homestuck albums were coming out every month?\n\nVolume 10's been an open question since the moment Volume 9 got released. Every few months, the music team would talk about it, maybe float a song or two for it, then nothing. Which, you know. Process. Life happens. A lot of us went to college, maybe lost interest, moved on to making [[group:undertale-and-deltarune|smash hit games]], what have you. We splintered. Fans wondered if it'd ever happen. I've gotten messages about it basically ad infinitum over the past four years, and it's not helped by one-off mentions here and there teasing it endlessly.\n\nPeople want to know what's up!\n\nWell, finally, here it is. If Volume 9 is the culmination of over three years of musical evolution and growth for its musicians, Volume 10 is the reunion tour. For those of us returning, its our chance to show how much better we got while we were gone (I think you'll agree we've improved quite a bit).\n\nAs for the new faces, I think their work speaks for itself.\n\nThis isn't only the tightest, most consistent, most listenable numbered volume we've done, it's the one we've put the most love into.\n\nI hope you enjoy what I've spent the past few months wrangling together with some of the most talented people I know.\n\nI present the final Homestuck Volume.\n\n...Probably.\n\n<i>Marcy Nabors:</i> (co-organizer, mastering engineer)\n\nHomestuck Volume 10, the big 1-0!\n\nI can only begin to describe what a personally significant moment it is to be releasing this album. Homestuck has been huge for me; the enthusiastic community and the countless friends it's helped me to meet, the sprawling fantastical expanse that is the comic itself, and perhaps most notably, the outrageous wealth of great music.\n\nAlmost six years ago, the Homestuck discography served as the push I needed to realize that I could chase my dreams in the world of independent music, and today I'm proud to call many of these immeasurably talented musicians some of my closest friends.\n\nPutting this album together has been an absolute pleasure, and I think it's a fitting conclusion to this seven-year-long tradition of incredible creativity.\n\nEnjoy the tunes!\n\n<i>Lexxy:</i> (cover artist)\n\nHomestuck will always hold a warm, nostalgic place in my heart, so despite drafting up a handful of concepts - from the graphic and representational to the tongue-in-cheek referential - I ultimately ended up going with the one that expressed that affection the most.\n\n<i>Robert J!

              "Commentary": "<i>Seth Peelle:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nWhen I first auditioned for the Homestuck music team back in 2009, one of my two audition pieces was [[Pumpkin Cravings|\"Pumpkin Cravings\"]], which ended upon the [[album:homestuck-vol-5|\"Homestuck Vol. 5\"]] album of the following year (and was subsequently orchestrated by the illustrious Alex Rosetti into [[THIS Pumpkin|\"THIS Pumpkin\"]] on THIS Album). The other piece was a short electronic-sounding demo entitled [[Skaia Voyages|\"Skaia Voyages\"]] that I based on the [[Sburban Jungle|\"Sburban Jungle\"]] and [[Skies of Skaia|\"Skies of Skaia\"]] themes, inspired by the purposefully vague notion of the Kids' \"ascension\" recently introduced in the comic at that time. The demo never ended up going anywhere in that form, but its musical ideas stuck in my head, growing and evolving in my mindscape over the years into something much grander than what I had originally envisioned. It grew additional references to [[Revelawesome|\"Revelawesome\"]] and the Kids' themes, grew a full orchestra, grew a massive choir and epic sci-fi noises of indeterminate nature...\n\nAnd then - eventually - it became REAL.\n\nIt ASCENDED.\n\n(yes it was totally that easy.<br>\nno you can't stop me from pretending this.)\n\n<i>PJ Tush:</i> (track artist)\n\nWOW 7 years of Homestuck. I only hopped on this hectic bandwagon in 2011, but it was definitely worth it. I NEVER would have expected to be able to contribute to and take part in Homestuck itself. This is like a dream come true. THAT BEING SAID: CREATA!\n\nCreata was heard [[Creata (Canon Edit)|in short]] during the first part of Collide, so being able to listen to the full version of the song and then DRAW for it was pretty cathartic (i might have cried). When drawing for Creata, I wanted to capture the \"essence of creation\" and highlight the greater purpose of the Beta kids in the creation of their universe. The piece is long and explosive, much like one would expect the creation of an entire universe to be. I wanted to depict a climactic moment, something grandiose and defining that fits in with the end of Homestuck properly. What better event than the Genesis Frog finally blooming with the original quartet?\n\n(i definitely did cry)"

I'd been watching a lot of Ruroni Kenshin with the girlfriend on Netflix and because this art was done by me as a last minute switcheroo I didn't have much time, so I did what I do best; I was a piece of weeaboo trash and made this ridiculous fake shounen manga panel in manga studio.\n\nThe Japanese reads \"Usagi o hako ni modore\": \"Put the bunny back in the box\".\n\nThe next day I landed a job working at a Sake company.

Goal here was mainly to create a \"Terezi doing something badass\" track: A little inspiration from things like [\"Battle without Honor or Humanity\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw5vAd5icAg) from Kill Bill, sprinkled with little bits inspired by [[Terezi's Theme|Terezi's theme]], then a bit of weird guitar solo for [[Harlequin]] to represent Gamzee, and a whole load of staccato strings and rhythm guitar everywhere else.\n\nOriginally called \"JUDG3M3NT D4Y\" but we already have a track called [[Judgment Day|\"Judgment Day\"]].\n\nWe've literally used all the names.\n\n\"Sound Judgement\" works better though, although it should probably be \"Smell Judgement\"?\n\nThat sounds ridiculous though.\n\n<i>Sera B.:</i> (track artist)\n\nFor this piece I wanted to go really comic book-y, so I leaned towards a Daredevil influence for Terezi (for obvious reasons). Initially, I had her in a more detailed setting in extreme light and shadow, with Gamzee's silhouette looming over her. Totally by accident I ended up deleting the background layers, leaving just the strip of red lava as the orizon-- which looked way cooler than what I had before and gave it the comic-book-cover vibe I was shooting for.\n\nSuper fun piece to work on!"

And it turned out pretty awesome.\n\nThe guitar performances haven't changed since the first recording, but just about everything to do with the mix and virtual instruments have been tweaked.\n\nAt the time, I was very influenced by Gojira, most noticeably in the rhythm guitars' super rythmic chugging around.\n\nAnd a fun fact: the double kick drum is augmented by a sample of the kick drums used in Septic Flesh's song [[track:anubis-septicflesh|\"Anubis\"]] to give it that perfect death metal punch.\n\n<i>Seth Massey:</i> (track artist)\n\nSome of the more \"mechanical\" designs in Sburb were fricken cool.\n\nWish we saw more of them.\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp blurb](https://web.archive.org/web/20160615084929/http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/track/skaian-overdrive))\n\n\\*note: track is not actually [[Skaian Starstorm|\"Skaian Starstorm\"]]<br>\n\\*oops"

Lake:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nCascade2 has a strange following online.\n\nThe post with the track itself (feel free to google around to find it) isn't that popular (though, relative to the rest of my blog, it's practically Michael Jackson) but the people who've heard it and like it are very vocal about it getting a release.\n\nSo, you know, here it is. Freefall hems pretty close to my original remix's overall arrangement, except it swaps out all the samples for newly recorded material (all me) and riffs way, way more loosely on the song quotes. This song is older than [[flash:4109|[S] Cascade]] is, and I think the difference between the original version from all those years ago and this is one of the most striking comparisons you can make to show how far I've come.\n\n<i>Nico J. Dolloso:</i> (track artist)\n\nI was approached by RJ to do a track art of my choosing for the album and decided to work closely with him for the track \"Freefall.\" The track's subject was the EoA5 flash [[flash:4109|'[S] Cascade']], which was from what I remember a clusterfuck on many levels in the Homestuck universe and for the MSPA wegbsite & Newground's hosting servers.\n\nIt sure was a ride I'll never forget.\n\nI'm pretty content with the result despite having a short notice to finish it. I wanted to reflect on the clusterfuck of the flash's narrative in these glass shards falling from the area of impact; I love compositions where you can notice something new every time you look closely at it. It also fit well with the title of the track as well.\n\nI also remember there being a lot of contrasting colours in the original flash, so I played with those in this image as well.\n\nVery glad to be able to have the opportunity to draw something for the album overall!"

Given the title of the track, a castle-exploration scene seemed to be a given.\n\nI knew I wanted to draw the trolls, and liked the idea of depicting Terezi and Vriska during the post-retcon timeline. So I went with one of the castles we see in a Dream Bubble.\n\nAlthough, compared to the vibe the song gives off, The Scourge Sisters seem a little too excited to be exploring this creepy old place. The piece needed something to give it a more ominous tone. A scrapped concept involved Karkat and the Mayor, so I put them in the forefront here to add a sense of urgency and foreboding - they're probably not in any actual danger, but Karkat's not gonna let his beloved Mayor get wrapped up in Terezi and Vriska's castle-plundering shenanigans. Visually, I was mainly inspired by the illustrations seen during the [ending credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJHV-zz5O1A) of Cave Story, and how effectively they used limited, almost monochromatic color palettes. I cycled through a lot of different colors for the piece before deciding on the blue/purple gradient here.\n\nStill not sure which one I like best!\n\nIn hindsight, I could have easily set this piece in any of the castles on Prospit or Derse, but then I couldn't easily include the Mayor. And I really, REALLY wanted to draw the Mayor.\n\nBesides, pursuing a more obscure concept forced me to get more creative with the scenario and composition.\n\nSo, ultimately, it's a win-win!\n\n<i>Kiko B.:</i> (alternate artworks, [Tumblr](https://kingcheddarxvii.tumblr.com/post/146932969357/some-alternate-flavors-of-castle-one-of-the))\n\nSome alternate flavors of Castle, one of the tracks I did art for in HS vol. 10!

              "Commentary": "<i>Seth Peelle:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nThe 1984 fantasy film \"The NeverEnding Story\" was one of my favorite childhood movies.\n\nIt was the first movie I ever remember watching at the theater, in fact!\n\nAnd the film's fantastic soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder and Klaus Doldinger had a lasting impact on my own musical creativity. Doldinger's high-energy orchestral theme [[Bastian's Happy Flight|\"Bastian's Happy Flight\"]], in particular, is something special that has stuck with me throughout my life like few musical pieces have - an inspiring masterpiece embodying childlike wonderment in its purest form.\n\n[[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew Hussie]] liked that movie, too, I guess.\n\nSo when Hussie came by my house riding a long magic dog through the sky and causing the absurd movie-referencing shenanigans called Homestuck, I somehow knew that the only proper response was to mash together the [[Skaian Ride|\"Skaian Ride\"]] and [[Skies of Skaia|\"Skies of Skaia\"]] themes into a nostalgic homage to Mr. Doldinger's soundtrack.\n\n(I am sure Mr. Doldinger - much like a certain ill-fated group of bullies - never could have seen THAT one coming.)\n\n<i>Alyssa Lee Dalangin:</i> (track artist)\n\nI wanted to illustrate Skaian Happy Flight when I heard it because the music was so whimsical and uplifting, I knew doing the imagery to match it would be fun. When I asked the musician what their vision was for a scenario or character, they said they didn't have anything in particular in mind (though they mentioned some influences from The Neverending Story, which Homestuck has also referenced.\n\nThere's a tiny Hussie riding a dragon in the background of my picture, based off a comic page I was shown, haha!)\n\nJust based off the song title, I decided to draw John flying through some pretty Skaian scenery, so I set to work doing preliminary brainstorming. I mostly wanted to settle on cohesive shape language for the sky and the trees, since I already had an idea of the overall composition, and I really wanted the picture to be wispy. Unfortunately I didn't save too many WIP shots, but my sketch was pretty straightforward and most of the struggle came from deciding the colors for John...\n\nOne of the WIPs I've included here is showing a roughly shaded layer for John that I ended up scrapping for the simpler coloring that's in the final version.\n\nThere were aspects of the more detailed coloring I liked, but I didn't want John to stick out as awkwardly rendered against the otherwise mostly simplistic background style. I had a lot of fun creating this piece and I hope it does the cute song some justice!"

With new drums, strings, electric pianos, a celesta, some synths, and a quiet, somewhat ominous epilogue, it was a doozy. I'm pretty sure the epilogue was inspired by a chord progression in a Sonata Arctica song. Something about the tone and instrumentation of the piece felt right at home with Sonata's synths. The piece is meant to convey both a relaxed and serene feeling on top of a somewhat melancholy and serious undertone. Calliope's void light spiral was a breather from the craziness happening elsewhere in the comic, but there was always the threat of English showing up."

As far as I can remember, I didn't have any particular inspiration when I wrote it, musical or otherwise. It's the catchiest tune I've ever made, yet I couldn't tell you how it came to me exactly. This version ias a completely unique take on this melody compared to the original context, giving it a very different Feel. I wasn't able to do any of the audio production for this track, but I did guide RJ as to how I Feel it should be put together. We ended up pushing the deadline too much with this one, and there are still a couple things I wish had been changed, but like with any creative work, you need to draw the line somewhere, lest you polish it endlessly.\n\nIn the end, I'm glad to finally share it with the world in some form, and I hope the world enjoys it.\n\n<i>Robert J! Lake:</i> (producer, arranger)\n\nThis is really Luke's song. I started the project file but he made it his own. The crow noises are mine.\n\n<i>PJ Tush:</i> (track artist)\n\nBeing so high energy, I wanted to make the piece as colorful as possible, but not unattractively saturated. Initially I planned on reflecting the characters in dream bubbles of their respective colors, but decided to depict them in full mugshot instead.\n\nEach character is lightly engulfed in a colorful overlay in front of the chaotic, perpetually expanding infinity of gay space.\n\n<i>Fenn:</i> (track artist)\n\n<i>Feel</i> is a very powerful song full of energy. We were inspired by the tension filled events occuring during the 3 year span of time between those stuck on the troll meteor, flying through space towards an unknowing and terrifying future.\n\n<i>Mika B.:</i> (track artist)\n\nWhen rendering the final rendition of the track art piece, I hoped to give it a complete finish that would accustom the pieces lovely concept art. I enjoyed working to convey the spectacular energy Jade is known to behold, particularly with her hair.\n\nOverall, this piece was a great enjoyment to work on, and I was able to accompany two great artists in their work to create art to represent Feel, as well as the teens' spiraling adventure on the gay meteor.\n\n<i>Robert J! Lake:</i> ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yngy9XIzRLY&lc=UgheYBDHMQfgt3gCoAEC))\n\n> RJ, if you arranged this piece, then there must be an original you used as a base. Is there some sort of file or sheet for that track?\n\nluke might have a famitracker file. the way it worked is basically that he wrote the vast majority of the melodic content in famitracker and sent that my way, and i incorporated it as i saw fit. some of it's completely my own - that bassline, and the break section, for instance, as well as the second solo - but most of it comes directly from just a few wavs he shot my way.\n\nso ask him, is my best advice!"

Hence the accordion. But then, like any other time I started feeling vaguely like making something into a piece for shipping people, I actually made the piece and got a way better idea for what it would be for, aka post-game everyone-hanging-out reflection-relaxation. And hey, the accordion still worked.\n\nI don't expect anyone else to be a Maria Schneider fan and also encounter this piece, but if they do, yes I pretty much took the first 4 bars of [[track:evanescence-maria-schneider|Evanescence]] and used it as the basis for the piece. A few other cues came from that piece as well.\n\n<i>Richard Gung:</i>\n\nA chill tune deserves a classy cover."

              "Commentary": "<i>Solatrus:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nI got inspired by listening to a friend's liquid drum and bass tracks back in 2014 (shoutout to you, Justin!), and decided I really wanted to do something along those lines.\n\nAnyway, life happened so this track collected dust until RJ and Marcy yelled at me to finish it.\n\nOh if you want to check out Justin's work, [go here](https://www.facebook.com/FliteDnB/).\n\n<i>Lunise:</i> (track artist)\n\nSo I was minding my own business one day, and then all of a sudden Jeremy came and asked me if I wanted to do some art for Volume 10. Naturally, I obliged, and I asked him if he had anything specific in mind that he wanted me to draw for it, and he basically told me to draw whatever came to mind. So I listened to the WIP of the track he sent me a few times to get a feel for what I wanted to draw for it, and jotted down a couple of concept sketches for what I wanted to do!\n\nThe first character that came to mind was Rose for some reason, and the track gave me a bit of a Skaianet vibe, so at first I sketched up a little composition featuring the meteor terminal in the Skaianet lab.\n\nI scrapped that idea because it would've been far too much detail for me to do in less than a week, so I thought I'd do something with Rose making her way towards Jasper's mausoleum, with a view of meteors falling from the sky. After all, a title like Starfall called meteors to mind!\n\nSo I sketched up that idea and liked it enough to see it through to completion.\n\nFun fact: Solatrus was surprised that the final track art was so red, because he felt like the music would inspire more blues, but he liked it a lot in the end.\n\nI always thought it'd be pretty cool to do something for an official album, and I guess that dream came true!\n\nI'm pretty happy to have had this opportunity to draw something for this album."

I figured it would be a sweet way to demonstrate the darker, more elegant aspects of the song and its liveliness at the same time.\n\nI chose to have Kanaya as the lightsource to put a little more of a literal spin on the title-- Rose as Lilith and Kanaya as her starlight.\n\nJust the two of them in their own little world, sharing a romantic moment!"

At that time it had a runtime of only one minute, so when Volume 10 was being organised I ran with what I had and extended it into the piece featured. I felt that the initial theme has a air of purity, something that lent itself well to the birth of a new world - hence its allocation.\n\nAt least, that's how I'm justifying it. In reality this can be considered a Calliope piece at heart.\n\n<i>Seth Massey:</i> (track artist)\n\nThis is a realy fantastic song that I'd been rooting for from the start, and when given the chance to do art for it I was intent on making sure it got the beautiful art it deserved.\n\nWe had very similar ideas for the visual direction, and I think I've done the concept justice."

The title is a referenced to the [\"THIS FUCKING PUMPKIN\"](https://www.homestuck.com/problem-sleuth/1080) line from Problem Sleuth.\n\nFor obvious reasons I decided to drop one of those words when naming this arrangement.\n\n<i>Worthikids:</i> (track artist)\n\nAlex's original request for this art was \"so here's the thing......\ncould u draw the what pumpkin logo....\nbut with an exclamation point instead of a question mark\nmaybe candy corn vampire-problem sleuth could be holding it?\"\n\nI remember drawing the altered logo all plain by itself and sending that to Alex,\n\nand he liked that fine,\n\nbut I was ultimately irked and redid it with candy corn PS a few days later.\n\n<i>Alex Rosetti:</i> ([Tumblr](https://rosettimusic.tumblr.com/post/100946585565/pumpkin-cravings-for-orchestra-original-by-seth))\n\n<b>[[Pumpkin Cravings]] for orchestra</b>\n\n*Original by [[artist:seth-peelle|Seth “Beatfox” Peelle]] on [[album:homestuck-vol-5|Homestuck Vol. 5]]*\n\nHappy Halloween everybody! I have emerged from the shadows to bring you a spooky seasonal treat! And what better time to do so than such a monumental Homestuck date, and sharing the release of an incredible [S] page?\n\nTruly the moons of Prospit and Derse saw to it that I would finish this arrangement on such a festive Homestuck eve! I’ve been working on it all month hoping to finish it by Halloween, and it has given me an all-new appreciation for the amount of detail and technique in Beatfox’s compositions. I hope hearing this orchestration of his 8-bit masterpiece can get that across to you too!\n\nI asked [[artist:worthikids|Worthikids]] to scare up an appropriate track art, so be sure to go knock on his door and give him candy for his beautiful contribution!\n\nTrack: THIS Pumpkin!<br>\nArtist: Arr.

              "Commentary": "<i>Seth Peelle:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nOh, hey. Is it the last track already? Man, where did the time go?\n\nWow. This piece has run through my head more times than any other that I've written for Homestuck. I hadn't been on the music team for very long before I felt motivated to create something in my head that could conceivably serve as a compelling closer to the comic, regardless of whether it ended up actually serving as such. Arguably the most thematically significant musical motifs in the comic - [[Sburban Jungle|\"Sburban Jungle\"]], [[Showtime (Piano Refrain)|\"Showtime\"]], [[Skies of Skaia|\"Skies of Skaia\"]], and of course, [[Homestuck|\"Homestuck\"]] - would all have their part to play. I first put it down into corporeal form in late 2010 as a full-length piano draft, but it wasn't until four years later that I began working on the final orchestrated version.\n\nEfforts to complete it over the next couple years were sparse and sporadic at best and fraught with technical issues, but thankfully I managed to make the deadline for the album.\n\nI wanted to make something that, although perhaps bittersweet, has a definitively happy ending.\n\nDespite all the super bad stuff that goes down through the course of the comic, Homestuck is ultimately a story with a message of optimism. Learning, growing, helping, loving.\n\nBlossoming individually, but also working toward a shared goal that's so much bigger than the individual and so totally worth it in the end.\n\nThese are themes that play out through the entire comic, but also themes that are reflected in our reality.\n\nI wanted this piece to be an expression of ideals that I, myself, believe in.\n\nI'm hopeful that you believe in them, as well.\n\n<i>Kiko B.:</i> (track artist)\n\nLook how far we've come! Beatfox did such a spectacular job combining so many early Homestuck themes here. Listening to \"Conclude\" for the first time was a major nostalgia rush!\n\nIt's a fitting finale to a fantastic album. I went through tons of variations of the same image of John and his friends looking off into the new world they'd built, but I couldn't quite nail down the concept.\n\nNothing, no matter how vast in scope, or how many kids I crammed in there, properly conveyed the feeling of finality befitting the final track on the album, and the end of HS itself.\n\nRealizing that my initial concept was leading me nowhere, I returned to Act 1 for inspiration.\n\nMy single favorite page in HS is [[flash:82|page 82]] - the soothing but foreboding sound of wind chimes ringing in the howling breeze might even be my favorite use of sound in the whole comic, period.\n\nIt was the first moment, when I began reading HS, that made me shiver with anticipation for what was to come. I wanted to evoke that moment here, only in a new light; one that brings John full-circle, acknowledges where he's been, and implies the possibilities of the future.\n\nI intentionally set the scene to look a lot like his yard in Act 1, with the \"THANKS FOR PLAYING\" text hanging in the sky as the one distinguishing feature that sets this piece post-Act 7. Here, John isn't gazing forlornly at his neighborhood in anticipation of a long day, but relaxing somewhere warm and familiar after that long day has finally come to a close.\n\nBy the way, I haven't forgotten that his ACTUAL yard isn't exactly intact by the end of Act 1, but I figured it was worth it to take a little artistic license to deliver what this track needed.\n\nIt's not TOO much of a stretch to assume that John or any one of his God Tier pals could have rebuilt his home in the new universe, right?\n\nRight.\n\nIt's my headcanon and I won't be shamed!\n\nOn a final and more personal note, Homestuck, and its music, hold a very special place in my heart.\n\nI began reading in 2011, so there was a lot of the comic and a lot of music to catch up on. I saved up so I could buy and binge it all at once. My favorite themes fueled many lazy days drawing fanart, which I eagerly shared online. I can sincerely say that doing so changed my life in many ways, as is the case with so many little, seemingly inconsequential decisions. Sharing my enthusiasm for HS led me to meet many dear friends.\n\nThat's an experience that I think HS encapsulates incredibly well - the incalculable impact something as simple as sharing something with friends can have.\n\nThis piece is my thank-you to Homestuck for that experience."

I used to take dance classes when I was a kid, and I have very distinct memories of a kindly old woman playing bouncy piano chords in ¾ time. One of the design choices Toby and I settled on really early on was that each character would have a \"room\" that be the purest form of their theme. Joey feels most at home in her bedroom, which is a sanctuary from the rest of the awful house she lives in.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nI think my original version of this was like 40 seconds long or something... James did a really good job fleshing it out and making it something that's listenable for long enough to look at the Bubsy poster 40 times in a row."

When we first came onto the project Andrew told us \"it's like a haunted house\" so we really made it like... spooky but months down the line Andrew was like \"ok lads reel it in it's not actually haunted just lonely\" so we switched it to piano and toned it down a bit. Toby ended up doing the final version of this one, though I think a piano version I did exists somewhere too.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nThis is one of the first tracks I did for the game. I'm pretty proud of how it turned out from a musical standpoint, though I guess it's kind of serious given how goofy the house looks. Whoops..."

Stripping down Toby's song in this way makes it sound kinda like Luigi's Mansion, which rules so it all worked out. This was originally going to be the theme for just downstairs. In the time since then, though we decided to have music changes based more on \"narrative\" and less on just \"location.\" You don't spend that much time upstairs so it would seem kinda silly to have the \"MAIN THEME\" of the mansion be heard for the two minutes you're in the hallway. You will see more of these dynamic music changes in ACT 2.\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nIt sounds kind of like Yoshi's Story to me. This turned out to be a really tuba-heavy soundtrack somehow. Maybe that's a good thing though.\n<i>James Roach:</i>\nWe just kept telling each other to add Tuba to things. Like some sort of Will They/Won't They Tuba standoff."

It is an extremely important moment in american cinema AND meta comedy. I'm honestly so surprised you hadn't heard of it. Anyway this is based off of \"SNAKE GENESIS\" which I wrote first.

That would be have been cool.\n<i>Cohen Edenfield:</i> (game director)\n(Hey Cohen here. several people have asked if the title is a reference to the aaron carter song. obviously it is, yes, that. James' song titles were good but they were usually a very direct reference to what actually happened in the scene they were playing for.

It's also funny if something's really good too. Maybe I just like to laugh. I am a man of much nuance. Anyway here is the ska song you begged me for. I wanted it to be a cheery version of Xefros's theme because it is the place in his house he probably feels most like himself. Surrounded by Anime and SPORTS! Quite possibly.. [the biggest mood imaginable](https://soundcloud.com/hiveswap/redacted-rumpus-room-refrain)?\n<i>Toby Fox:</i>\nI couldn't stop him from putting a ska song on the soundtrack sorry guys\n<i>James Roach:</i>\nI would love to see you try little man.\n<i>Cohen Edenfield:</i> (game director)\n(I don't know what anime he's talking about. I guess the paused Arena Stickball match on the TV is pretty anime-looking. But James also sees anime everywhere, wherever he goes.

              "Commentary": "<i>James Roach:</i>\n(Chahut's theme)\na little over three years ago i was in a sweaty conference room in manhattan visiting the now defunct WP NYC studio (which was in a shared space sort of... tech venture situation??) sitting in on what was usually a remote meeting. I nervously stood in front of andrew and my director at the time (whos name was also james come to think of it) as well as a handful of other people. Toby was conference calling in like we both usually did.\nThey said since i was visiting from out of town I didn't have to present anything at this weeks meeting like i usually did. I said I had something to show them anyway, since I didn't like to sit around idly and wanted to make the most of my studio visit. I stood there half-moist with gross air-dampness only new york in summer can really provide knowing I had one opportunity to wow them in person.\n\"alright. remember all those sound effects for that highblood minigame? like... seltzer water? light bulb? honks? squeaks? ok well, I made them into a beat and added some airhorns and tuba-\"\n\"more tuba?\" said toby over the call\n\"hell yeah brother more tuba\"\nanyway this was that song. It was going to be for a minigame sequence but i wanted to use it here. originally it didn't have a melody so i wrote a melody on banjo since you should definitely be reading all of chahuts lines in a very slow, methodical louisiana genteel southern accent. \"SANGLE and ready tuh MANGLE\""

I have been saying saying \"boyo\" a lot lately. oh god is the lad.... me??? no probably not.\n\nthis song started off as a track for my best friend at the time [[artist:lexxy|Lexxy's]] fantroll very creatively named \"Lexxer\" back before homestuck fantrolls were \"post-ironic\" and still \"sincere.\" I also put the melody to [[track:nuclear-james-roach|\"nuclear\"]] in here as a throwback to my old fantroll \"Carcha.\" I have said fantroll more times today than I have in the last year. Fantroll.\n\nthis is the closest to ska that friendsim has got just because in its original iteration this is a weird like... electronica ska song.\n\nanyway i say it \"started off\" as that but i literally wrote this track on like.. monday. thats how ya boy do. I borrowed from a song i wrote for a fantroll album i did. theres a whole fantroll album that... hasn't really stood up to the passing of time so I've mostly purged it from existence. I guess some chuckleheads found it but have been kind enough not to repost it."

I could dweeb out about this for hours."

I didn't design her or draw her or write her but I will gladly take the credit from my esteemed colleagues and friends.\nif you didn't listen to the podcast i was on this morning (pgenpod) or watch that youtube video i uploaded a few weeks ago this track was originally for an area that was scrapped. The important characters got more or less morphed into Marsti as we know her now.\nThere is a whole like section of the game where this melody is used a lot. Its in the old 3D hiveswap trailer, in the Homestuck 2.0 video. Wow. All the cursed ones. It is explicitly not a leitmotif because it is not meant to be \"..indicative of a person or place\" it is just a theme.\nwait but... if i make it marsti's theme does that not mean it, however inadvertently, is now a person's theme and therefore IS a leitmotif? aw jeez guys i really beefed it this time.\nthis ones a bit older but this is, once again, just another example of me goin ham on bass for no good fuckin reason. i just think it sounds cool what do you want from me."

The idea here is that you start with a normal song and slowly work your way to the weird clown shit. this is meant to reflect the real life struggle of finding someone hot and slowly but surely acclimating to the fact that they are a clown. we all been there. extremely relatable.\ni got that weird laugh from toby as an mp3 and i THINK its from a spiderman game. it could just be toby's own impish laughter but probably not. toby has a hearty joy-filled laugh with exactly 0% in the vein of clownery department. i love toby so much.\nso here we are. friendsim friday and i have to act like clownfuckery is just another aspect of my life akin to say a sweet tooth or psoriasis. like \"yeah man we all done fugged a clown once am i right fellas\" over here grasping at straws, desperation in my voice \"r-right??? fellas???\"\nhis name was daniel and he really loved ICP and i think now he works as a manager at a taco bell. yeah thats right daniel. i'm callin you out you nasty juggalo. my inherited army of teens are comin into your taco bell and taking all your fuego sauce. dont call me. that felt good. i feel better. what were we talkin about?"

In ACT 1, the song \"[[track:keep-your-head-down]]\" has a [[track:drone-pesterquest|rhythmic motif]] that I use in the climax of this song. I wont tell you what its for but... think of whats happening during that song in ACT 1, and know that it will be a much bigger deal when you eventually see it. i don't have any information wrt \"when\" that would be helpful to you. its barely even helpful to me. a real \"buddy, they dont even let ME fuck the flag\" situation. this is a reference to a popular tweet. im not an insane person i swear.\nanyway nihkees sprite is absolutely fucking ripped. the size of this lad. the A in LGBTQA+ stands for ABSOLUTE UNIT apparently.\nI know it does not please do not @ me i am so fucking tired."

It was an incredible opportunity with a lot of ups and downs and emotional significance. it will probably continue to be that. I had a lot of fun doing all of this for you. it also... ate up a LOT of my time, though. I have been on a nonstop homestuck train for like the last five years and only now that i've gotten into the groove of things its ending again. bittersweet. for now.\ni don't really know how to feel but i hope i at least wrote a song or two you liked along the way.\nheres the one for MC/DOC SCRATCH that i think is my favorite from the whole thing. its based off a song from an old (bad) fantroll album i did in like 2011 (and the song was written even earlier than that) that i have since purged from the internet as best i can. thank you for not reposting it. i re-used a lot of assets from it for other stuff. i was in a real weird place when i made it so aside from it being kinda bad i just... don't wanna see it ever LMAO.\nthat album made the homestuck music community real mad at me because they thought i was getting preferential treatment for being popular on-line and friendly with some WP staff on twitter. my unofficial album got approved for sale and at the same time, completely unknown to me someone on the music team's album didn't get approved. a handful of them used this incident to talk shit about me for several years. one of them made fun of me for my dad passing away?? yikes. most of us have made our peace (i understand how easy it is to get caught up in dog-piling on a common enemy or w/e) but theres still one or two that are like... still real mad at me for this percieved slight. they'll say like \"you were rude to us\" and its like... you guys... literally made fun of me for not having a family i'm not sure what you want from me.\nthis one got away from me. anyway. thanks for listening. stop being weird to me on twitter. tip your waitstaff."

Here is a link to the booklet by itself if you just want to see it!\n\nThe art is also soon to be featured on the Homestuck Music Wiki, which preserves old official art for all the tracks that had it before the Bandcamp reorganization.\n\nWe’re glad to contribute to the tradition of track art that interprets and expands upon Homestuck music!\n\n<i>Ucklin:</i> (booklet commentary - back)\n\n<b>Artists</b>\n\n[[artist:zowerlemon]]<br>\n[[artist:jas]]<br>\n[[artist:rachel-z]]<br>\n[[artist:dpaq]]<br>\n[[artist:ghastaboo]]<br>\n[[artist:ysh]]<br>\n[[artist:spicy-nyx]]<br>\n[[artist:rainbowlustdash]]<br>\n[[artist:mikkynga]]<br>\n[[artist:tipsy]]<br>\n[[artist:zzzealousy]]<br>\n[[artist:ana]]<br>\n[[artist:skyplayer]]<br>\n[[artist:qsleeper]]<br>\n[[artist:cratmang]]<br>\n[[artist:aeritus]]<br>\n[[artist:star-nomad]]<br>\n[[artist:awkward]]\n\nThis list contains quite a few new arrivals to the team as well as some long-time contributors returning.

The majority of artists were invited on May 1st, and art was completed by the 31st. I'm glad we get a chance to appreciate the artists on our team: So many of these people could be spending their time making money with their art, and they're helping us enrich and expand on the Homestuck soundtrack instead!

That’s a shame, so let’s have fun while we draw 18 pieces of amazing art to go with each amazing song.\n\n*SIGNUPS CLOSED! Stay tuned for the results!*<br>\n<s>ARTISTS, APPLY HERE</s>\n\nThis project is inspired by the *[Homestuck Vol. 5 Track Fan Art](https://alterniaart.tumblr.com/)* and the *[Alternia Art projects](https://vol5anthology.tumblr.com/)*. Check out these links to see what kind of images we’d be looking for.\n\n<b>GUIDELINES:</b>\n\n* Artists are encouraged to catch up with the Homestuck^2 webcomic! Art will focus on scenes and characters from it, after all.\n* Track art dimensions will be a square 1400x1400 pixels or bigger to match other Bandcamp track arts, one track art per track. While this isn’t required, art that still looks good at small sizes tends to make for better track art, keep that in mind.\n* At the very least, the final project will produce a downloadable file with the 18 pieces artists have made, so make sure you’re fine with that before applying! A PDF booklet will be released with some commentary if enough artists provide it. We’ll also try programming something that people can use to add the track art to their copies of the album automatically.\n* Because of copyright and other reasons, this is an unpaid fan project.\n* Make sure you only sign up if you’re certain you can finish the art in ONE MONTH, based on how long it usually takes you to finish a major art project. While there’s no particular hurry and you won’t be held to that deadline, we’re trying to avoid the scenario of a single missing track art stopping everything.\n* Deadline for the signup form is APRIL 30TH, 23:59 PM EST. Around a week later, we’ll contact artists and invite them to the UMSPAF Discord if they’re not already there. Coordination and progress updates will take place in the #art channel of the UMSPAF Discord, and you may be required to be aware of pings and such. There is currently no deadline set in stone for the project itself.\n\nWe hope you apply!\n\n<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Bandcamp credits blurb](https://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/beyond-canon))\n\nAlbum produced by [[artist:clark-powell]]\n\nAlbum cover art by [[artist:xamag]]\n\nFeaturing tracks by:<br>\n[[artist:horizon]]<br>\n[[artist:david-ellis|David Ellis (A Lunatic's Daydream)]]<br>\n[[artist:polysaw]]<br>\n[[artist:sean-gorter|Sean \"Flare\" Gorter]]<br>\n[[artist:xauric]]<br>\n[[artist:erik-scheele]]<br>\n[[artist:alex-votl]]<br>\n[[artist:marcus-carline]]<br>\n[[artist:waif]]<br>\n[[artist:twirlin-curtis]]<br>\n[[artist:circlejourney]]<br>\n[[artist:sean-william-calhoun|Sean William Calhoun (Do the Musicy Thing)]]<br>\n[[artist:monobrow]]<br>\n[[artist:clark-powell]]<br>\n[[artist:mathias-ramalho|Mathias \"FriendlyCoy\" Ramalho]]<br>\n[[artist:tristan-scroggins]]<br>\n[[artist:robert-j-lake|rj lake]]<br>\n[[artist:emelia-k]]",

The best to represent the song in my opinion was Rosebot: in the song the singer is repeating \"you just made a monster,\" acknowledging that they themselves are no longer a person and informing their initiator of what they had done. While designing the drawing I decided that rosebot had to be the center of attention of the piece so I focused on her color pallet and her aspect, light, was made to be just as robotic as she is, with orange metal linings as an example of ult dirks influence on her. The purple background is taken by her lunar sway, also, it was a good color to accompany the yellow in the piece. The rest are random metal plates with lining in between each plate forming a sort of tunnel with the only light being Rosebot and a clock of the moon and the sun surrounding her, each with their own meaning. In the end I love how the final piece came to be, I feel that it represents the song very well, and I had fun sharing with the organizers and the other artists. To be the first time working in this manner in a community was nice and I hope in the future to have similar opportunities like this.

Eventually, I decided that Jade possessed by Alt. Calliope was the best fit, because the upbeat mood of the song fits Jade's personality, and the name was also very fitting for both characters since their aspect is space. I interpreted the \"Cosmic Carousel\" as the black hole turning endlessly in space while Alt. Calliope acts as the conductor as she watches over the various timelines. After my first sketch, I had Jade wield Calliope's wand, and I also gave her a happier expression to fit the overall mood of the song.\n\n<i>Rachel Z:</i> (art anthology WIPs)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip2.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel-wip3.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<i>CrepesAhoy:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/cosmic-carousel.jpg\" width=\"250\">"

But turns out that they indeed Were Back, and I'm really looking forward to what they have in store. Dirk, the ==> command, and the Theseus seemed like the perfect trinity to represent a(n) (un)likely continuation to an already colossal story. The sky full of faint memories of the baffling/fascinating (Meat) Epilogues, Dirk as the constellation marking him as one of this universe's gods, the one who put that story into motion. There's another simpler track art I made that I also enjoy, but in my mind the piano and the stars go together much better, the one with Dirk and the huge ==> command feels like it'd accompany some electronic song instead.

Between a bunch of depressive episodes and just outstanding amounts of imposter syndrome, I had a lot of anxiety that I wouldn't even be able to make a track that was in the ballpark of \"good\", let alone at all worthy of being on the first official album of Homestuck^2. And for a while there, I wasn't really making things I was at all enjoying or proud of. I was worried of making something that wasn't \"homestuck\" enough, or wasn't something people were really expecting. But the support of the amazing Homestuck music team helped contribute to a track I can firmly say I'm proud of, and even being included on this album means the world to me.\n\nSo I really, really do hope you guys enjoy this <3\n\n<i>ghastaboo:</i> (art anthology commentary)\n\nOriginally I had drawn events throughout the timelines, though in my opinion, it looked a bit too much to focus on, so I scrapped that version, and, unfortunately I did not save that version, oops. Either way, I hope my abstract-y space-y art did the job, made a blackhole to represent, well, the blackhole which Alt. Callie turned into, added some green and orange effects for the narrative command battle going, though there's already a track for that, so it is minor, in the background, the real focus are the timelines, meat drips with death, candy is sweet and bright, though they both have some masks for what's really going on, we cannot see though, the reality is split and we're in SPACE.\n\n<i>ghastaboo:</i> (art anthology WIP)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/split-reality-wip.jpg\" width=\"250\">"

So I did my best to convey all of that. The track uses many synth sounds, or at least *some* synth sounds, and to me that was enough to justify going for the 80's neon aesthetic. I used mainly triadic palette where each colour corresponded to one of the characters: orange for Dirk, violet for Rose, teal/turquoise for Terezi. The theme of \"three\" is also reinforced by the triangle shape, which I referenced in composition as well as by slapping a big fat triangle in the middle of the picture. It works as a visual portal and also represents the letter Delta (as in Deltritus, the name of the new planet). The idea of actual assembling of the game is referenced through the Venn diagram glyph inside the portal and by those sick grid mountains in the background that I totally didn't trace from some random stock image. There's some more symbolism stuffed in the picture but this commentary is already too long and I'd like to leave some things open to interpretation. Doing track art has been a long dream of mine, and I'm extremely glad and thankful I've been given this chance to participate in this project!\n\n<i>ysh:</i> (art anthology WIPs)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip2.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/assembly-wip3.jpg\" width=\"250\">"

It's cool to see Homestuck^2 parallel some stuff from OG Homestuck, and it's especially cool with the heartfelt or hopeful moments; paralleling is largely where my art inspo came from. Seeing John and BGD aiding Jake again is great, especially since that was near the end of OG Homestuck, while Homestuck^2 is beginning with that (which seems to be the case with other stuff, too, like Jade being possessed). Furthermore, it's that teamwork/hopeful stuff (like John and BGD aiding Jake, but also Dave comforting Kanaya, etc.) in Homestuck^2 that really feels like the idea of \"beginnings in endings\" to me, whether it parallels OG Homestuck or not. All of the characters are struggling right now, and it's nice to think that they might be able to help each other out and make something together out of all that struggling.\n\n<i>zzzealousy:</i> (art anthology WIPs)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip2.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip3.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip4.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun-wip5.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<i>Circlejourney:</i> (original track art)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/after-the-sun.jpg\" width=\"250\">"

I might transcribe this for my music project.\n\n[[media:album-additional/beyond-canon/Narrative Command blueprint - Sean William Calhoun.pdf|This might make it a bit easier]] — I made a notated blueprint before I started producing it (notated on two piano grand staves, because that's easy for me to parse, but it's certainly not a playable two-piano score). It's not 100% accurate to how it wound up (and I'm not going to fix it, because I don't have any use for an accurate \"score\"), but if you take this as a slightly-flawed transcription you can probably get the rest relatively easily.\n\n> I don't want to do this beautiful track a disservice by comparing it to music that's already been made, because it's one of the most original and creative songs ive ever heard, but it also does kind of sound like all the songs on [[album:cherubim|Cherubim]] had a brawl and kicked the shit out of each other\n\nIt intentionally sounds tangentially like a bit of OG Homestuck music (without quoting anything). Calliope's music is a little like some of [[album:one-year-older]] (like [[Firefly Cloud]]) and [[Voidlight]] (from [[album:homestuck-vol-10|HS Vol. 10]]). At the beginning of Homestuck^2, Dirk said \"Finally, this story is back on the rails. Maybe we can get back to what things were like in the good old days,\" so his music sounds more stereotypically Homestuck, with the quasi-chiptune style that's in a lot of classic Homestuck music.\n\n> > > have fun trying to transcribe dirk's 13/8 section lmao\n> >\n> > *but consider: 13/4*\n>\n> but consider: 13/1\n\nMy notational thoughts aren't really consequential, since this is electronic, and the score was only for my own ease of composing, not for performance, but I've always thought of it as Calliope's section in 4/4 and Dirk's in 13/16, so when they start to combine, it's 4 (Calliope eighth notes) against 13 (Dirk sixteenth notes)\n\n<i>Ana:</i> (art anthology commentary)\n\nI believe the real protagonist of this song is Jade Harley.

Even the same symbolism can be found in other pieces: Theseus streaking across his face, shatters of memories lost to space. Mine started to mutate though, to take on a form beyond my control. My skill to render the memories failed me: WIPs show the corpse of John, the beheading of Dirk, other fragments of the Epilogues. The main decisions of the piece happened spontaneously: fragments of a clock reforming to Dirk's silhouette, Theseus moving from the corner and taking its place as Dirk's glasses. The colors went through many iterations, a volatile photoshop file of hue shifts and stacked filters. The final nail in the coffin for any hope of a semblance of normalcy in this came with my most baffling decision of all: splashing my previous two track arts for UMSPAF over this one. My original monochrome draft for Diverging Delicacies' \"Dirk's Dreamers\" became the only shattered memory, a destruction of art I birthed but am not fond of. Moons of Theseus' \"Unchained\" merged with the fibers of space, a celebrated giant looming over all my other pieces. Much like the man this art is focused on, the very piece itself has become a distractingly shiny mirror reflecting the artist's self-indulgent nonsense.

In the end, I didn't really do many different concept sketches for this one. I knew that I wanted a scene of Tavros, in his Peter Pan outfit, staring out as the friends and army they'd worked so hard to gather get eaten by the black hole. The ghosts are just as much the 'Lost Boys' here as Tav is himself. I was going for a 'wistful, but resigned' sort of feeling for this, since all Tav can really do now is watch. He knows he's unable to stop everyone from being destroyed—or, as we know now, getting pulled into the new HS^2 universe.

Most everything in the picture came out naturally, with a few tweaks here and there. I had John looking looking sad in one iteration, but I felt it didn't match up with the more upbeat nature of the song, so I changed it. I did sort of trip at the finish line when adding details to the buildings in the background.

Lake:</i> ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/spellbang/status/1250780820287164419))\n\nmight as well talk a tiny bit about this song, Four Kids (and a Game They Played Together), since people are responding to it way more strongly than i kind of expected\n\nthe original version of the track from yeaaaaars ago i wrote as an instrumental i intended to be the \"homestuck end credits theme,\" which ended up not panning out for a bunch of reasons, but the song was always a fave of mine, and stuck around on my hard drive until i polished it up as [[track:four-kids-and-a-game-they-play-together|the finale of the main portion of Stuckhome Syndrome P1V1]]. i still love this version of the song very much.\n\ni had a vocal version brewing in my head for ages. literally from before stuckhome syndrome was released. i mean, the first line (it's been a little bit since the last time we all talked/so how are all of you doing?) was just a sudden thing about me getting volume 10 together\n\ni never had anything besides that opening line, though, not really. for ages i thought i'd finish it up for the last stuckhome volume (i haven't even put the 2ndtogether...but i will! this year probably?) but a lot  ended up hitting me in the interim and i didn't have time for it\n\nabout five months ago i was contacted to be a part of the homestuck 2 music team and was told the lowdown: it was a clean slate, and a chance to establish the musical rockbed for homestuck 2 going forward. no quotes of hs1 songs whatsoever, but we'd be making new songs TO quote\n\ni messed around with a few other demos but it was pretty quick for me to settle on deciding to do this. since four kids was never actually released as part of homestuck proper, it ended up feeling like the perfect time to pull the track together for real.\n\nthough the instrumental of the new version came together with steady work over the past few months the actual vocals and lyrics didn't coalesce until about two weeks ago. i had messed around with dozens of variants until then; the only stuff finalized earlier was the chorus\n\nsinging it was fresh hell because it's stretching my range extremely hard, but i didn't want to do pitch correction. on the final track there is some on the backing vocals for two parts, mostly to help finish the thing quickly, but the majority of it is natural\n\nit was endless, endless retakes and it still sound bad to my ears but i think the roughness maybe helps the emotional quality of the song? i guess?\n\nfor my part, i'm just glad it's done and i'm glad it's apparently good. anyway. thanks\n\noh and lastly i guess speculate all you want about the meaning of the song but i'm not going to engage with any of that stuff because i kinda feel like what the song is feeling is clear without my input on that front\n\nbut. yeah. thanks again. <3\n\n<i>star-nomad:</i> (art anthology commentary)\n\nWhile this piece is canonically about the composer, listening to it made me strongly think of John, specifically from the Meat timeline. Since the title of the song basically encompasses John's life during Sburb and by extension his fight with Lord English in the epilogues, I wanted to do something reminiscent of these ideas. Thus I went with the idea of some of the last remaining dream bubbles, and how they show pivotal points from the game session that John was apart of or would remember. I decided to also go with different color palettes, but each having a similar enough scheme that the bubbles showed cohesion. It was a very fun piece to work on, and is hopefully symbolic enough of John and his memories!\n\n<i>star-nomad:</i> (art anthology WIPs)\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip1.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip2.jpg\" width=\"250\">\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/four-kids-and-a-game-they-played-together-wip3.jpg\" width=\"250\">"

I had written a really somber and melancholic track for the area outside the hive (the farm in the concept art) and changing it into something a little goofier and weird presented a unique difficulty for me. I just didn't know what to do for the first time in like actual YEARS i had no idea where to even start. I kept at it for a very long time and eventually just muscled through it with sheer force of will. People often ask me the hardest track or my least favorite to work on. it was this one. silver lining: its also become one of my favorites. i love how it came out. thats the power of determination. did you know you can't say determination anymore.\nthis was written for, yes, the fabled beekeeper troll that nobody will talk about. its become some sort of myth as to what happened to her but the truth isn't that exciting. in early hiveswap days each member of the crew got to \"pick\" a character that they could choose one design element of. The person who picked beekeeper just had a fantroll based off of herself. they also just... drew micro/macro porn of themselves? a power move, honestly. I met them in person and they offered me weed within literal minutes of meeting so i mean i guess they seemed nice. when they no longer worked for the company it was just simpler to redesign the character than deal with literally any of that. mystewy sowved :)\nat the point in production where they were figuring out names/personalities/traits they kinda thrust this one on me because it \"would make the most people angry.\" beekeeper troll was beloved by a very specific kind of horny dude. you know the kind that regularly says \"lewds\" or w/e. nothin wrong with that i guess. chase your bliss. but in an effort by my SO CALLED FRIENDS to antagonize me, they were like \"heh h h e h he e e he h what if we make this cute girl character that hornyboys love into a dumpy little round dude and then say we based him off james who they already do not like.\"\nthanks guys.\nanyway zebede's bullet points and even his name are references to me but thats kinda where it ends. st. james son of zebedee is also known as santiago, which is my birthname. the tongva were \"maybe\" the indigenous people of long beach, where i live, which is \"too far to visit\" which is a joke about The Greater Los Angeles Area. I live 20 minutes away. cowards."

      "Commentary": "<i>Homestuck:</i> ([Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358520/Pesterquest_Soundtrack/), excerpt)\n\nEnjoy the fine-grooving tunes of Pesterquest, the grimsical episodic visual novel adventure set in the darkly funny Homestuck universe.\n\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nThis soundtrack released exclusively on Steam as paid DLC for Pesterquest; it's got some quirks, discussed below, but is probably the best and only official release of Pesterquest's we'll ever see.\n\nMost tracks were originally composed by [[artist:james-roach]] for Pesterquest; almost all of his tracks were included on this soundtrack release, though six were not:\n\n- [[track:2chords]] (\"Dave Route Prelude\")\n- [[track:drone-pesterquest]] (not credited)\n- [[track:its-a-cover-of-made-of-time]] (not credited)\n- [[track:its-nothing]] (not credited)\n- [[track:mspar-remember]] (\"Chaos Audio\")\n- [[track:normal-song-name]] (\"Afterw@rd Theme\")\n\nVarious tracks from prior releases were [[flash-act:pesterquest|featured throughout Pesterquest]]. Some of these were released again on this soundtrack, while others weren't. Featured in Pesterquest from earlier Homestuck releases, and not on this soundtrack:\n\n- [[track:worst-end]], by [[artist:james-roach]] (\"Prologue Theme\")\n- [[track:end-of-friendvangelion]], by [[artist:james-roach]] (not credited)\n- [[track:superego]], by [[artist:yan-rodriguez]] (\"Vriska's Theme\")\n- [[track:bronze-rebel]], by [[artist:yan-rodriguez]] (\"Tavros' Theme\")\n- [[track:the-la2t-frontiier]], by [[artist:toby-fox]] (\"Eridan & Sollux battle\")\n- [[track:stress]], by [[artist:buzinkai]] and [[artist:toby-fox]] (\"Dirk's Theme\")\n- [[track:embittered-shore]], by [[artist:max-wright]] (\"Reader's Theme\")\n\nPesterquest features several tracks by artists who weren't formally part of the Homestuck music team. Across the lists above and the main track list, these are tracks featured from the Homestuck fan community:\n\n- [[track:superego]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]\n- [[track:indigo-heir]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]\n- [[track:bronze-rebel]], from [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]]\n- [[track:embittered-shore]], from [[album:lofam2]]\n\n[[album:hiveswap-friendsim|In Roachian fashion,]] most track names have slight (to significant) differences between their soundtrack release on Steam, individual track releases on SoundCloud, and the in-game credits list. All of these are noted on each track; on the wiki, the album's track list extracts the \"main\" part of the name of each track as part of the Steam release.\n\nThe album cover artwork is from the Steam library; track artworks for select James Roach tracks are from their releases on SoundCloud.\n\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nDuring the timeframe where this album hadn't yet been released on Steam, [[artist:tempest2k]] and other fans compiled the new tracks featured in Pesterquest into an album ready for anyone's music library, including full metadata and track artworks. This lacks the tracks featured elsewhere on Homestuck's discography, so it compliments the rest of a Homestuck library quite well.

It was supposed to come out back on 6/12 but our new publisher had us sit on it for reasons that are beyond even me. Anyway, big ups to [[artist:malcolm-brown|Malcolm]] and [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark]] for letting me use their themes.\n\nI don't know if I'll have as much time or energy to do the tracks for pesterquest like i did for [[album:hiveswap-friendsim|friendsim]] since i got a new job.

These things don't exactly pay well to begin with tbh, so i thought I would use the platform i've been given to try and do something... even a little positive.\n\nat first the song was just going to be called \"play the rain\" because naming it something stupid, while keeping up with tradition, seemed like it would be in bad taste. at some point while i was working on it i started looking into various charities i could donate the proceeds to, and it hit me that i could just ask to make the title in the credits a link to the charity.\n\nsuicide is something that is hard for me to talk about. its very personal. i tend to internalize feelings in order not to.. bother anyone. a few months ago i called a suicide hotline when i hit a really low point and i think just the act of calling made me feel... in charge somehow? feelings are fucked up. don't be afraid to talk to someone. even if it is a stranger at the other end of a call. take that step. you're not bad for feeling that way.\n\nso anyway. endless climb was one of the very first homestuck songs that really drew me in, and doing a cover of it all those years ago really got me back into taking composition seriously. it could easily be argued that this song changed my life for the better.\n\nif you want to know more about the trevor project, or just suicide prevention in general visit [thetrevorproject.org](https://www.thetrevorproject.org/)"

LMAO\n\nmusically i have jade start on bass, and as more of her friends come in she gets a little more confident in her basslines. anyway thats my fanfic.\n\nthis is the last new piece i'll be doing for the forseeable future, or until i feel like doing another one which might be immediately. ive been doing this on a largely volunteer basis for a while since the budget constraints were tight and we need to pay the bg and sprite artists a reasonable amount. I wanted all four kids to have music by me and i think we'll be digging into the homestuck archive for other stuff.\n\nanyway i hope you've enjoyed the ride! its been a little bittersweet at times for me but i'll miss posting new stuff every two weeks."

The professor decided to allow the class to decide as a group what the genre would be and whose song they would use.\n\nDespite the entire class consisting of guys who play guitar, no one had the guts to suggest a genre offhand. The biggest slacker of them all, a white kid with dreadlocks who had missed half the classes, half-heartedly suggested reggae, an offer which the teacher accepted.\n\nThe teacher asked for people to volunteer their songs. Again, no one was ballsy enough to speak up - Scott was one of the few who had written a song from time to time, but since his usual faire is stuff about death, loss of innocence, and [[track:fruity-pebbles-jingle|Fruity Pebbles]], he thought maybe it was best to abstain from this poll. Songwriting duties were given to a black-haired faux-goth at the back of the room who claimed to have written \"a lot of songs\" but that they were all \"just lyrics\" and no music.\n\nThis should have been a red flag to the earnest professor, who spent the next couple of days matching her \"song\" to music. The entire class found itself sitting in on the extra-spooky recording sessions for her love song to the undead titled \"Falling for Ghosts\" in what was the invention of the new genre Emo Reggae.\n\nOn the last day of class, everyone showed up with a CD containing their own personal mix of the song. It must have been monotonous sitting there hearing \"Falling for Ghosts\" over and over with little-to-no variation between versions... except of course for this one with some SCARETACULAR additional material which Scott decided to record and add in at the last second.\n\nTL;DR when you get to the 3 minute mark, everything will suddenly make sense.\n\n<i>Scott Stutzman:</i>\nI did a mix of a classmate's song as a school project. (I added a little somethin' to the middle. I don't think she liked it.)"

I've remade this track maybe 2 or 3 times, because I always liked it, but I never felt like my skills quite matched up to the vision I had for it... It's meant to be a duet between a student and a teacher, that was the original intent of it... As a graduation song, it's kind of bittersweet, and, uh, I had some friends tell me they cried when they heard it. I guess it was just, like, the context and everything."

What can we do?\nYou and I are same in the way that we have our own styles that we won't change\nYours is filled with evil and mine is not, there is no way I can lose!\n\nCan't hold on much longer - But I will never let go\nI know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this will last\nI'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others\nClose my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do\nOpen your heart, it's gonna be alright\n\nAncient city blazing\nShadows keep attacking\nLittle children crying\nConfusion, hopeless anger\n\nI don't know what it can be but you drive me crazy\nAll your cunning tricks make me sick\nYou won't have it your own way\n\nCan't hold on much longer - But I will never let go\nI know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this will last\nI'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others\nClose my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do\nOpen your heart, and you will see\n\nIf it won't stop, there will be no future for us\nIts heart is tied down by all the hate, gotta set him free\n\nI know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this will last\nClose my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I gotta do\nGotta open your heart, dude\n\nCan't hold on much longer - But I will never let go\nI know it's a one way track - Tell me now how long this will last\nI'm not gonna think this way - Nor will I count on others\nClose my eyes and feel it burn - Now I see what I've gotta do\nOpen your heart, it's gonna be alright, yeah\n\nOpen your heart\nOpen your heart\nYeah"

The otherworld it takes you\n\nGo go into the sand and the dust and the sky\nGo now no better plan than to do or to die\nFree me pray to the faith in the face of the light\nFeed me fill me with sin now get ready to fight\nYou know you will\nYou know you will\nYou know you know you know you know that you will\nYou know you know you know you know that you will\nYou know you will\n\nFight fight fight\nFight fight fight\nFight fight fight\nFight fight fight\n\nHope dies and you wander The otherworld it makes you\nDreams they rip asunder The otherworld it hates you\nFree now ride up on it Up to the heights it takes you\nGo now if you want it An otherworld awaits you"

              "Commentary": "<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nThis track scores parts of EarthBound's prologue. The first half, titled on soundtrack releases as 逆襲 (\"Counterattack\" or \"Strike Back\"), is the main menu opening; the second, 眠ってる場合じゃない (\"This Is No Time to Be Sleeping\"), plays during an in-game walkaround near the start of the game.\n\nThe first half is known online as \"The Evil Giygas Attacks!\" (in two parts) and the second as \"One Fateful Night...\" and \"Unidentified Falling Object\". These names all appear to trace to [Starmen.net](https://starmen.net/mother2/music/) since around [June 2007](https://web.archive.org/web/20070621190644/http://starmen.net/mother2/music/), and previously to [SNESmusic.org](http://snesmusic.org/v2/profile.php?profile=set&selected=783) since [May 2004 or earlier](https://web.archive.org/web/20051222040706/http://snesmusic.org/v2/profile.php?profile=set&selected=783). The English name \"Prologue\" is given on the official 2016 vinyl release; the part names don't seem to have received official localization.\n\nSince the official soundtrack release really isn't online anywhere, the YouTube links on this track are for the versions from Starmen: [The Evil Giygas Attacks! (Part 1)](https://starmen.net/mother2/music/002-%20Earthbound%20-%20The%20Evil%20Giygas%20Attacks!%20(Part%201).mp3), [The Evil Giygas Attacks! (Part 2)](https://starmen.net/mother2/music/003-%20Earthbound%20-%20The%20Evil%20Giygas%20Attacks!%20(Part%202).mp3), [One Fateful Night...](https://starmen.net/mother2/music/009-%20Earthbound%20-%20One%20Fateful%20Night___.mp3) and [Unidentified Flying Object](https://starmen.net/mother2/music/010-%20Earthbound%20-%20Unidentified%20Falling%20Object.mp3). The duration is taken from the 1994 soundtrack release."

While you may remember the track being faster, it in fact was always this same speed but often mangled by running a PAL region game at NTSC speed (resulting in a 20% speedup)."

Galoshes!\nPinkie Pie: More balloons! Oh no, that's too many balloons. More candy! Oh, less candy. Oh wait, I know. Streamers!\n\nRarity: Streamers?\nPinkie Pie: Whose dress is this?\nRarity: Streamers it is\nRainbow Dash: What?\nRarity: Aren't you going to tell me to change something too?\nRainbow Dash: No, I just want my dress to be cool\nRarity: Do you not like the color?\nRainbow Dash: The color's fine, just make it look cooler\nRarity: Do you not like the shape?\nRainbow Dash: The shape's fine, just make the whole thing... you know, cooler. It needs to be about 20% cooler\n(Pinkie Pie) All we ever want is indecision\n(Rainbow Dash) All we really like is what we know\n(Twilight Sparkle) Gotta balance style with adherence\n(Fluttershy) Making sure we make a good appearance\n(Applejack) Even if you simply have to fudge it\n(All) Make sure that it stays within our budget\n(Rarity)\nGot to overcome intimidation\nRemember, it's all in the presentation!\nPiece by piece, snip by snip\nCroup, dock, haunch, shoulders, hip\nBolt by bolt, primmed and pressed\nYard by yard, always stressed\nAnd that's the art of the dress!"

You're too slow\nSo I step on the gas, to speed up the mow\nDidn't see that sprinkler underneath that tree\nWham! Ccchhh! Pssshh! Raining on me!\nI go Whoa, Homer goes\nD'oh!\nNow you can't go to the boatshow\n\nThis is my thanks after working my butt off?\nHomer revs the motor and they all start to putt off\nSoaked to the bone, standing in a puddle\nNo-one needs to tell me I'm in deep, deep trouble\n\nTrouble\nGo to your room\nBart!\nYeah, right\nBart, go to your room\nDeep, deep trouble\nGo to your room\nBart!\nOh, gimme a break\nThe young begins the trouble\nWell, you're damned if you do\nI know the answer\nWell, you're damned if you do\nDeep, deep trouble\nWell, you're damned if you do\nAnd you're damned if you don't\n\nAs soon as they're gone, I'm stretched on the lawn\nLookin' at the sky with my sunshades on\nNow I've never ever claimed that I was a smarty\nBut inspiration hits me, lets have a party\n\nCalled up my posse, they were here in a flash\nThey brought all their pals, we started to thrash\nThere was romping and stomping, an occasional crash\nA fist fight or two on Nintendo for cash\n\nWe raided the fridge, dogs raided the trash\nI got a little worried when the windows got smashed\nThe next thing you know, Mom and Dad are home\nThe kids disappear and I'm all alone\n\nEverything's silent except for my moan\nAnd the low, bluesy tone of a saxophone\nThey look at me, then they go into a huddle\nGet this sinking sensation I'm in deep, deep trouble\n\nTrouble\nD'oh\nOh\nBart!\nOh, gimme a break\nDeep, deep trouble\nHey, what is this?\nDon't keep trouble\nGo to your room\nOh yeah\nBart, go to your room\nDeep, deep trouble\nGo to your room\nOkey, dokey\nBart!\n\nThere's a little epilogue to my tale of sadness\nI was dragged down the street by his Royal Dadness\nWe rounded the corner and came to a stop\nThrew me inside Jake's Barber Shop\n\nI said, please sir, just a little off the top\nDude shaved me bare, gave me a lollipop\nSo on my head, there's nothing but stubble\nMan, I hate being in deep, deep trouble\n\nTrouble\nWell, you're damned if you do\nTrouble! Trouble!\nWell, you're damned if you do\nDeep, deep trouble\nWell, you're damned if you do\nAnd you're damned if you don't\nNothing but trouble\nAw, come on, man\nWell, you're damned if you do\n(What are we talking about?) Well, you're damned if you do\nDeep, deep trouble\n(Where's your sense of humour?)\nWell, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't\nTrouble\nDeep, deep trouble\nHa ha ha, ha ha\nDeep, deep trouble"

This folk song originated in northwestern Germany sometime in the early 19th century. As with most folk music, it evolved from a shifting amalgamation of various earlier melodies— one notable one being a 1761 melody by Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. It's since spread in a variety of forms throughout eastern Europe, and in the 21st century, through China, Korea, and most importantly Japan, where it became a popular children's song. Lyrics here are based on a 19th century songbook."

              "Commentary": "<i>Niklink:</i> (wiki editor)\n\"Farewell Song\" was first published in a self-made songbook \"Songs Song by R.D. BURNETT. The blind man. Monticello - - - Kentucky.\" in 1913. Those original lyrics are printed here verbatim, with the exception of adjustments to punctuation. However, later in life Dick Burnett himself was unsure of whether he composed the song entirely by himself or drew upon other works. Research has found tentative roots in hymns and folk songs from Kentucky and Virginia throughout the 19th century; as a traveling street performer Dick knew a vast amount of such works.\n\nWhile the song was first recorded in 1927 by Dick, Columbia Records did not release the recording, making Emry Arthur's 1928 recording the earliest. It is this version that is linked here, and this version that first adopted the name \"I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow\" which the song is now commonly known as."

              "Commentary": "<i>Niklink:</i> (wiki editor)\nThe first known versions of Greensleeves date from the 1580. Two versions of the ballad were registered on the same day, one as \"A Newe Northen Dittye of ye Ladye Greene Sleves\" and another as \"Ye Ladie Greene Sleeves answere to Donkyn hir frende\", but the tune certainly predates these versions and authors. There have been countless variations of the lyrics and other lyrics set to the tune, but its association with Christmas came at a later date. The provided lyrics are from the 1584 publication \"A Handful of Pleasant Delights\", where it was known as \"A New Courtly Sonnet of the Lady Green Sleeves. To the new tune of Green Sleeves.\"\n\nI've made some effort to update the spelling to modern standards, but don't blame me if some verses don't rhyme; blame the Great Vowel Shift."

              "Commentary": "<i>Niklink:</i> (wiki editor)\nThe Magnificat is a canticle also known as the \"Song of Mary\", \"Canticle of Mary\", or \"Ode of the Theotokos\" (Theotokos is a Greek title for Mary roughly meaning 'Mother of God'). The text is taken from the Gospel of Luke 1:46-55; this section of the gospel is known as the Visitation. Traditionally a doxology (the Gloria Patri) is appended to the canticle, but is ommitted by Part in lieu of repeating the initial line. The Latin text is from the Vulgate, the provided English translation is from the Book of Common Prayer.\n\nAuthorship of the Gospel of Luke is traditionally attributed to Luke the Evangelist, mentioned as a companion of Paul the Apostle, though the actual text is anonymous. The gospels of Mark, Matthew, and Luke all share large quantities of material, and the literary relationship between the three is unknown (the 'synoptic problem'). However the Magnificat is material unique to Luke. Seen through the lens of some of the most common synoptic theories, this could mean the material was indeed authored by the author of Luke, taken from a lost 'Q source' of material from which Matthew and Luke drew (and Mark did not), or taken from a different lost 'L source' from which only Luke drew."

              "Commentary": "<i>Niklink:</i> (wiki editor)\nMessiah has 53 movements. A full performance of the oratorio usually takes over two hours, not counting intermission time. However it is most enduring in popular culture—and probably being referenced in this wiki because of—the 44th movement, aka the \"Hallelujah Chorus\", and that movement is the only one included in the provided lyrics.\n\nThe words are from the King James Bible, Revelation 19:6, 11:15, and 19:16. The Book of Revelation claims to be written by 'John' on the island of Patmos. Christian tradition claims this to be John the Apostle and also John the Evangelist (author of the Gospel of John), but scholars generally consider these to be three different people and separate the author of Revelation as 'John of Patmos'."

You know that's unheard of\nI never wear buttons but I got a cool hat\nAnd my homies agree, I really look good in black, fool\nIf you come to visit, you'll be bored to tears\nWe haven't even paid the phone bill in 300 years\nBut we ain't really quaint, so please don't point and stare\nWe're just technologically impaired\n\nThere's no phone, no lights, no motorcar\nNot a single luxury\nLike Robinson Crusoe\nIt's as primitive as can be\n\nWe been spending most our lives\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nWe're just plain and simple guys\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nThere's no time for sin and vice\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nWe don't fight, we all play nice\nLiving in an Amish paradise\n\nHitchin' up the buggy, churning lots of butter\nRaised a barn on Monday, soon I'll raise another\nThink you're really righteous? Think you're pure in heart?\nWell, I know I'm a million times as humble as thou art\nI'm the pious guy the little Amlettes wanna be like\nOn my knees day and night scoring points for the afterlife\nSo don't be vain and don't be whiny\nOr else, my brother, I might have to get medieval on your heinie\n\nWe been spending most our lives\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nWe're all crazy Mennonites\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nThere's no cops and traffic lights\nLiving in an Amish paradise\nBut you'd probably think it bites\nLiving in an Amish paradise\n\n(Ooh, ooh, yech!)"

(Eat breakfast)\nWhat should I do? (Each lunch)\nWhat should I do? (Each dinner)\nWhat should I do? (Go to bed)\nWhere can I go? (Go to the store)\nWhere can I go? (Apply for jobs)\nWhere can I go? (Go to a friend's)\nWhere can I go? (Go to bed)\n\nI wrote \"Beach Death\" when I thought you were taken\nI wrote \"Beach Funeral\" when I knew you were taken\nI wrote \"Beach Fagz\"—well it wasn't about you\nBut it could've been, well no it couldn't have\nI spent a week in Ocean City\nAnd came back to find you were gone\nI spent a week in Illinois\nAnd came back to find you were still gone\n\nI pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends\nI never came out to my friends\nWe were all on Skype\nAnd I laughed and changed the subject\nShe said \"what's with this dog motif\"\nI said \"do you have something against dogs\"\n\nI am almost completely soulless\nI am incapable of being human\nI am incapable of being inhuman\nI am living uncontrollably\n\nIt should be anti-depression\nAs a friend of mine suggested\nBecause it's not the sadness that hurts you\nIt's the brain's reaction against it\n\nIt's not enough to love the unreal\nI am inseparable from the impossible\nI want gravity to stop for me\nMy soul yearns for a fugitive from\nThe laws of nature\nI want a cut scene\nI want a cut from your face to my face\nI want a cut I want\nThe next related video\n\nI don't want to go insane\nI don't want to have schizophrenia\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\nThe ocean washed over your grave\n\nLast night I dreamed he was trying to kill you\nI woke up and I was trying to kill you\nIt's been a year since we first met\nI don't if we're boyfriends yet\n\nDo you have any crimes that\nWe can use to pass the time I'm\nRunning out of drugs to try\n\nWe said we hated humans\nWe wanted to be humans\n\nGet more groceries get eaten\nGet more groceries get eaten\nGet more groceries get eaten\n\nA book of Aubrey Beardsley art\nCorrupted me in youth\nNow I'm trapped inside my youth\nAnd you're in love with last-stage youth\nThank god for the little things and and\nFuck god that they're little things I am\nRunning out of prayers to sing and I\n\nAnd pretty soon you'll find some nice young\nSatanist with braces and one\nCapital o significant Other\nAnd you can take him home to your mother and\nSay ma, this is my brother\n\nWe said we hated humans\nWe wanted to be humans\n\nGet more groceries get eaten\nGet more groceries get eaten\nGet more groceries\n\nGet eaten by the one you love\nWhen they put their lips around you\nYou can feel their smile from the inside\n\nLast night I dreamed he was trying to kill you\nI woke up and I was trying to kill you\n\nYour ears perked up\nI perked up when your ears perked up\nYou were all looking around\nAnd I hoped it was for me\nI hoped you were using your sonar systems for me\n\nThe ancients saw it coming\nYou can see that they tried to warn them\nIn the tales that they told their children\nBut they fell out of their heads in the morning\n\nThey said sex can be frightening\nBut the children were not listening\nAnd the children cut out everything\nExcept for the kissing and the singing\n\nWhen they finally found their home\nAt Walt Disney studios\nAnd then everyone grew up\nWith their fundamental schemes fucked\n\nBut there are lots of fish left in the sea\nThere are lots of fish in business suits\nThat talk and walk on human feet\nAnd visit doctors, have weak knees\n\nOh please let me join your cult\nI'll paint my face in your colors\nYou have a real nice face\nI had an early death\n\nThe ocean washed over your grave\nThe ocean washed open your grave\n(how's your face?

At the end of my childhood, I put these ways behind me. For now, we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known\n\nAnd now these two remain:"

It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big that I didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town; was studying, and when I finally broke away from school and became a musician I thought, \"Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance\". Because all I really wanted to do is music, and not only play music, but compose music. At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques. So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque, sing maybe thirty minutes. I think I had about seven, eight songs. I would partially sleep in the car because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about almost two years to survive in the beginning. I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s, and then have a sound of the future. And I said, \"Wait a second, I know the synthesizer. Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?\" And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track which then was synced to the Moog Modular. I knew that could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realize how much the impact would be.)\n\n(My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio.)\n\n(Once you free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being \"correct\" you can do whatever you want. So, nobody told me what to do and there was no preconception of what to do.)"

Are you deceiving me?\nCould I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?\nIs your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?\nWould you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?\nIf I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off\nIf the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car\nWould you judge me a drug-head or see me as K.

I was gonna call it \"Another Nigga\" but, it ain't really a poem. I just felt like it's something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holler at you. I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa- About a metaphor actually, uh, you spoke on the ground. What you mean by that, what the ground represent?)\n(The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil.)\n(Right.)\n(That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see—and the ground is the symbol for the poor people)\n(Right.)\n(The poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people 'cause the rich people gonna be so fat. And they gonna be so appetizing, you know what I'm sayin' wealthy, appetizing the poor gonna be so poor, and hungry.)\n(Right.)\n(You know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be, there might, there might be some cannibalism out this muh-fu- They might eat the rich, you know what I'm saying?)\n(Aight so let me ask you this then. Do you see yourself as somebody that's rich. Or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?)\n(I see myself as a natural born hustler. A true hustler in every sense of the word, I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most menial and degrading job, and built myself up so I could get it to where I owned it. I went from having somebody managing me, to me hiring the person that works my management company. I changed everything, I realized my destiny in a matter of five years, you know what I'm saying? I made myself a millionaire, I made millions for a lot of people, now it's time to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying? I made millions for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for, for us.)\n(And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?)\n(By my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in \"All good things come to those that stay true\".)\n(Right.)\n(You know what I'm saying? And it was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was noticing, shit, I was punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you know I mean, it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know, I'm finna go straight through.)\n(Would you consider yourself a... a fighter at heart or somebody that... somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?)\n(Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been, uh, threatened with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but, it goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to fight back.)\n(Aight well, how long will you think it take before niggas be like, \"We fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I can't win and I wanna lay it all down\".)\n(In this country, a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong, while you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back.'Cause once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man, out of a black man, in this country, and you don't wanna fight no more. And if you don't believe me, you can look around, you don't see no loud mouth 30-year old motherfuckers.)\n(That's crazy, because me being one of your offsprings of the legacy you left behind, I can truly tell you that, there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so, I wanted to ask you, what you think is the future for me and my generation today?)\n(I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot it's gonna be like, uh, bloodshed, for real. I don't think America know that, I think America think we was just playing and it's gonna be some more playing but, it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be murder, you know what I'm saying? It's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831, up in this motherfucker. You know what I'm saying? It's gonna happen.)\n(That's crazy, man, in my opinion only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations. Lot a people don't understand how important it is, you know. Sometimes I can like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of energy I'ma push out or where it comes from, trip me out sometimes.)\n(Because it's spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us.)\n(Damn.)\n(I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote, describing my world, it says:)\n\n(The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it\nIts only job is to eat or consume everything around it\nIn order to protect itself from this mad city\nWhile consuming its environment\nThe caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive\nOne thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him\nBut praises the butterfly\nThe butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness\nAnd the beauty within the caterpillar\nBut having a harsh outlook on life\nThe caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak\nAnd figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits\nAlready surrounded by this mad city\nThe caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon\nWhich institutionalizes him\nHe can no longer see past his own thoughts\nHe's trapped\nWhen trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as\nGoing home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city\nThe result?\nWings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant\nFinally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations\nThat the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle\nAlthough the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different\nThey are one and the same)\n\n(What's your perspective on that?)\n(Pac? Pac? Pac?!)"

Oh, my Earth\n\nI might be chasing waves of light, out towards the rim\nWhere stars are sparse and the cold of space seeps in\nOr I might be in a bar-room drinking methylated gin\nAnd thinking of the places I have been\n\nFor I have seen many worlds, for what it's worth\nWill I ever, see again, the planet Earth? Oh, my Earth\n\nCast adrift amongst the stars I float from sun to sun\nDreaming of the world that gave me birth\nAll the places I have seen remind me there is none\nTo match the cool green rolling hills of Earth\n\n\nMay I remember, when I have travelled on\nThe Earth's a cinder, swallowed by the sun\nThere is no meaning, nor can there be\nJust an ember, burning in the night, on a velvet sea\n\nI didn't guess the implications when I saw the light\nThen I saw the desolation, burning, burning bright\n\nMay I remember, by what I still have left\nA bag of Earth dust, hanging at my chest\nThere is no memory that I would sell\nThat is worth the half of all that's left\nOf Earth's blackened shell..."

Sharon, what's your question?\"\n\n\"Contestant number one, I believe first impressions last forever. So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house and have dinner with me and my family. Tell me what you would do to make that first impression really stick\"\n\nLet's see, mm, well, I'd have to think about it\nI might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it\nI'd probably just show up naked like I always do\nAnd look your momma in the eye and tell her, \"FUCK YOU!!!\"\nHurry up, bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti\nI'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, \"Get the food ready!\"\nYour dad will probably start trippin' and get me pissed\nI'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!\nIt's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother\nI'd pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother\nI'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this\nYou know for only thirteen, she got some big tits\nAfter that, your dad will try to jump again\nAnd only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin\nAfter your mom does the dishes and the silverware\nI'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear\n\n\"Now, let's meet contestant number two. He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak who works for the Dark Carnival. He says women call him Stretch Nuts. Sharon, let's hear your question\"\n\n\"I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions, a man who expresses himself in his own special way. Number two, if you fell in love with me Exactly how would you let me know?\"\n\nFirst thing, I could never love you\nYou sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!\nBut if I did, I'd probably show you that I care\nBy taking all these other motherfuckers outta here\nI'd go through your phone book and whack em all\nAnd find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (What?!)\nAnyone who looked at you, would have to pay\nI'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day\nI'd grab your titties and stretch 'em down past your waist\nLet 'em go, and watch 'em both spring up in your face\nI'd sing love songs to you, the best I can\nGet you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!\nThen we'd go to the beach and walk through the sand\nI'd throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin'\nAs you spit it all out, I'd rub your back\nAnd grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!\n\n\"Well it sounds like contestant number two is just over-flowing with sensitivity, Sharon. It's a tough choice so far! Sharon, let's have your last question and see which one is going to win the rights to your neden\"\n\n\"Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would your pick up line be?\" (Well) \"Whoever's the smoothest wins!\"\n\nOkay, first I'd slide up to the bar\nAnd tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are\nI'd tell you that I like the way you make your titties shake\nAnd if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Ricki Lake\nFuck that, you'd be jocking me quick\nI'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick\nAnd then to get your attention in the crowded place\nI'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face\nYeah, freak her with your nuts, yo, that'll get her\nTell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better\nLook, fuck you, I got a strong rap\nShit, you don't want contestant number two. He's mad wack\nI walked into a barn and there he was\nStanding up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it\nIt was a big fucking smelly-ass farm llama\nDamn dawg! How you gonna diss your momma?!"

Whoof, baby, what a comic! You have fucking magical bullshit kids going in doing triple flips, aliens, you know all the good stuff. And uhh, it's fun! I enjoy it. It's a grand, grand time. It's fun. Uhh, there is, as most popular things do, there is a Reddit page for it. And, in that Reddit page there's plenty of fanart, fucking shitposting and all that jazz, whatever, it's cool. But uh, it's moderated by this guy named [[artist:makin|Makin]]. May-kin? It's M-A-K-I-N. There's no apostrophe, so it's like... Makin. Mack in— I don't know, he's a bit of a fucking cock? He's so fucking disoriented, fucking hypocritical, condescending, total f— just a cockhandle in general. And uh, he's like, screaming about one thing, and then he goes on and starts liking this comic, which is literally just memes, and, honestly I probably wouldn't care about that as much if not for the fact that he's like the main guy that everyone's like, oh yeah he's controlling I don't f— the Reddit and the Discord group. The Discord fucking group is a huge goddamn waste of time and it's also just a lot of bullshit people screaming at each other and shitposting, and every now and again you'll get a nugget of just like, oh, that's interesting conversation! But then it'll go back to screaming, and just, well if— if you want that, look at one of my other thing, which is like uh, when you're scrolling through a convo, and it's, that's basically just screaming, that's basically what the Homestuck thing is. And also, hold on, wait, no, no don't leave. There's also another thing I gotta say. The fucking, I don't even— I'm not even gonna look up what it's called but it's like [[group:canmt|New and Great Comic]] or whatever? That shitty, re— trying to uh play off of Homestuck like oh eh eh eh look how cool it is! That's just memes. That is just memes! And it fucking sucks? And I don't know how anyone likes it! I mean it's fine, you can enjoy it, but I don't. But don't fucking like, fucking hang me from a cross saying that I'm like the worst guy ever because I don't like it. I'm sorry, I just find like, overuse of memes to be rather, just unappealing and boring. But 'pparently everyone fucking gets their goddamn jammies wet. And I don't know, I feel like it's just kind of dumb, fucking, like okay we get it, memes are funny. But not all the fucking time? And even Makin knows that, he's like, eyyy I'm so smart, fucking, I don't really like memes all the time, but then he fucking, strokes this goddamn comic's cock like it's the best next thing. Maybe he can't let go that Homestuck's dead, but I don't know he fucking hated the ending, he's just like, it's the worst thing ever! Hey uh Makin I didn't r— I didn't really like Collide. [blubbering] Uh, hey Makin, I thought the music for this is just kinda meme stuff and I didn't really like it that much? I'm, I'm sorry, but you know, I that's just my opinion. Duh, I thought you— I thought you were like someone intelligent, but now I have, now I know you have no taste! It's like okay Makin, let's fucking, let's fucking take a little chill pill, okay? [blubbering] No no, Makin Makin, chill out chill out. [blubbering] No Makin! Take a chill pill. [blubbering] Alright, well this is my opinion on things— No! No! [blubbering] What, no! That is wrong! That is, I could not believe you would think that, obviously you're a fucking retard! It's like okay Makin let's fucking chill out, okay? Holy fuck! If Makin disagrees with something that you think is right, or you have an opinion on something that uh, it is like not the same thing as Makin's, he'll flip his fucking shit! It's like alright Makin, are you fucking like, thirteen? Or are you fucking, like are you gonna act your age? Also he's called the fucking salt king or whatever the fuck, and somehow that's good? Salty means that you're always angry, and a bit— bit of a bitch? So I mean if Makin's taken that title, phew, man, hate to see what a, oh boy, yeah you get the point. Uh, why'd I do this? I don't know, I was hearing a lot of fucking bullshit. Also, I left that group because Makin was being a fucking piece of shit to me, just fucking screaming at me. It's just kinda dumb, I enjoy Homestuck, then when this shit happens it's just like, great, uhh there's good parts of the fandom and then there's this. I'm sitting here like, dude, let's do some comics, let's do some music, let's do some fucking voice act— that's fun. Then it's like hey, uhh, what about we just be super cancerous and uhh, make like a buncha shit. Um, but you have so much other stuff you can do. You have good, like, music people who are willing to do music. But, like w-wh-w-w-wha-what if we made, what if we made memes! I mean, yeah that's fun, but how about some... real stuff? Naaaaaah... naaah... nah, I like memes. Alright, fine. So what was t— was the point of this? I don't fucking know. I just wanted to talk about something, and also, I mean I don't know if other people will agree with me with this, but Makin's a fucking cock. The Discord server's fucking disorganized and horrid, fucking, Christ, the fucking not safe for work part of it is like, you gotta be eighteen or older! Ehh, ehh, why? Uh we're we're doing it 'cause of legal reasons! Who's fucking looking at this? No one dude. Also, like who's checking the ages? Literally all you have to do is say I'm eighteen, and they're like alright, come on in. Who fucking— the people who don't wanna go to not safe for work is not gonna go where it's not safe for work! Who fucking cares? If some fucking thirteen-year-old posts his dick! Fucking, people getting in fights with the moderators, fucking moderators being cockhandles, fucking admins being like [blubbering] whatever. It's not, it's not good. Well that's just my opinion, it's my opinion, lemme just put my hand up and say that so, I don't get fucking shot to the head by uh, some kid who's like, it's the best Discords what the fuck are you on! I don't know! This is getting too long, whatever, I'm— I'm not even gonna fucking edit this, I'll post this and uhh and I'll see what the reaction is. Either people being like, yeah it makes sense, people being like it's okay, or I'm just gonna get an onslaught of just screaming and Makin be like, you fucking bad! Anything you do I'm gonna fucking delete, ugh! 'Cause that's the kind of guy Makin is, the cockhandle. Though i— though he'll fucking show this and be like, hoh, thf— look at Mush, look at Mush, dude. Ugh, he fucking— he thinks he's so cool? Yeah, well, lemme say a bad th— a few bad things about Mush! Mush, oh my god!

Roblox replaced this sound with a different one on July 26th 2022. Tommy Tallarico is currently the legal owner of this sound effect, but Hbomberguy has made [an almost 2-hour long video](https://youtu.be/0twDETh6QaI) discussing who is the actual creator.\n\nThe \"Unknown Artist\" here is the young girl being heavily edited. (see [1:51:34](https://youtu.be/0twDETh6QaI?t=6754) of the aforementioned video)\n\nIn case you don't have time to watch it, here's the most important part:\n\n<i>Tommy Tallarico:</i> (sound effect copyright owner; [Twitter, deleted](https://archive.is/MxlsC))\n\nAs seen in recent YT videos the sfx used in Roblox was created by my lead sound designer [[artist:joey-kuras]] back in the late 90's."

I wrote the first version of \"Bane\" in 2001, and this version (the 'latest' one) was written in 2005. It's been a long time since I did anything with this theme, but I still really like it. I've been thinking about making a [[track:bane-p-s|newer version]] of it (since surely I've gotten better over the past decade, right?).\n\nI kind of regret not slipping this theme into Homestuck somewhere; I feel like this could have easily been a recurring signature theme for projects I work on (like [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]] does with '[[track:megalovania-halloween|Megalovania]]')."

Daywalker nonetheless marks my first attempt at using real audio in a song - I recorded the flute performance myself. Unfortunately, my playing, recording, and production are definitely not up to snuff, honestly. Given that it was recorded with a terrible laptop mic, with a player who hadn't played in a long while (me), I suppose that was honestly no surprise.\n\nHowever, I love both the harp and flute melodies in this song. It was a blast to play, and I'd definitely think about using them again at some point in the future."

I get asked a lot for this, so I decided to give it some extra love and attention.\n\nI have attempted a number of times to put together a mix of Flare that utilized the distinctive crescendo that is recognizable [[track:flare-cascade-cut|from Cascade]], but it never seems to work well without the cinematic context. The buildup sort of leads to nothing, and then the track either ends awkwardly or fades out, and I have something personal against fade-outs. Maybe I'll talk about that someday. But not now.\n\nI gave it another go, this time trying a decrescendo to bring the song back down from all the energy it riles up, then ending it on kind of a creepy note. I had more success here than I ever have in past attempts to cut the song together in this way.\n\nFlare was a pretty big hit in its own right, so there's always the pressure coming from the responsibility to handle this properly. I hope you enjoy it!"

The rich wall of sound therein owes itself to the fact that it samples [[Viva la Vida]], from its namesake Coldplay album. Jane Dargason is a spiritual successor, using samplework from [[Life in Technicolor]] off the same album. All of this is combined here to surprisingly lovely effect with sounds from an unreleased track by RJ (who, as we have discussed, is the coolest).\n\nIn short, we have an anthemic Jane tune in the workings!\n\n<i>Quasar Nebula:</i> (wiki editor)\n\nThis upload to Tumblr featured artwork by Tavia Morra which would eventually end up used on [[album:homestuck-vol-9]] for [[track:princess-of-helium]], rather than [[track:jane-dargason|the final version of this track]] (which featured art by [[artist:dawn-davis]] instead)."

Feel free to skip my blathering below and just listen to the music though!\n\nI always felt like PS was at least partially a callback to 90s point 'n click adventure games along the lines of Grim Fandango, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island, Sam & Max, etc. so this song is intended to reflect that. If you imagine PS as a video game, this is the song that would play at the very start of the adventure while our heroes are messing around in their offices and getting caught up in all kinds of shenanigans.\n\nNow, the nice thing about PS is that the three main characters (Problem Sleuth, Pickle Inspector and Ace Dick) all have some strong themes that make it easy to come up with appropriate musical motifs. In fact, the three musical instruments that appear fairly early in the comic ( A trumpet, a clarinet and a tuba) all are pretty obviously intended as metaphorical representations of the three heroes, which means that as a composer I have my work cut out for me.\n\nThe idea with vertical layering in this song is that depending on which of the protagonists is currently 'on screen', the theme uses different motifs and lead instruments: when more than one protagonist is on screen their motifs are played at the same time and combined. Normal playback methods don't support this kind of interactive music (many game engines do, however), so this particular version is more of a proof of concept that just demonstrates the different layers and highlights how they interact.\n\nThe first section after the intro belongs to Problem Sleuth. He's the leader of the bunch, and to reflect his mario-esque all-around average strength, his motif is played on a muted trumpet in the middle register with a combination of short and sustained notes.\n\nAfter that we come to Ace Dick. His motif consists of short notes played on a tuba and backed by trombones and timpani to throw some appropriate weight around.\n\nPickle Inspector goes third with sustained notes played in the higher register of a clarinet. He's a bit of a loopy character so there's some glockenspiel and a lot of chroma... chromatics? chromaticity? to give it a bit of whimsy\n\nThe fourth loop combines the motifs of all three characters to demonstrate the interaction between layers when all three are present. The final loop is a variation on the Problem Sleuth motif with an added theremin and a delay effect on all the instruments to give it a 'spacy' sound: we're entering the realm of imagination and the music becomes appropriately screwy."

Music that didn’t quite make it. Since I’m not updating enough amma talk more about cancelled tracks you may have heard snippits of a while back but never appeared on any album)\n\nAah “Mother”, this one was conceived back around [[album:homestuck-vol-9|Vol. 9]] as a Rose track, originally under the assumption that post-scratch Rose would be important and act as a kind of parallel to Rose’s Mom pre-scratch. As usual this wasn’t the case, and instead she surfed out on a blaze of glory and ICP related shenanigans.\n\n“Mother” was basically planned as post-scratch [[Harlequin]], but with flavours of Ms. Lalonde.  As such, it’s essentially [[Aggrieve]] in the style of Harlequin.  Then it’s blended more with my usual weird Chiptune-with-bits-of-orchestra thing.  The net result is kind of a more mystical, studious piece.\n\nI kinda like it, but it doesn’t really do anything, and its only original bits are abandoned fairly quickly due to the shortness of the track.  Plus when it became apparent that post-scratch Rose has pretty much no influence on the plot, it was brushed to one side and I started on something else."

Not a huge amount of Karkat/Terezi injection in yet, or percussion for that matter, but I’m hoping to combine the two in some glorious union that will make even the hardest, strongest, man-horse-lusus be reduced to a pile of quivering tears and black liquid sorrow.\n\n(The name’s a spin on the Hanz Zimmer track [“You’re so cool”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aRDZ6z9yT8) from the movie True Romance, but with some radical Latula Pyrope twist)"

Leave you needin' an ambulance\nYou winning in this rap-off? Now that's motherfucking miraculous\n\nThank god that awful Act's over, you're getting no applause here\nAll your \"sick fires\" were faker than you being god tier!\nYour chucklevoodoo nonsense ends up as a slurred blur, so\nSomeone should ring Aranea and silence you like Kurloz\n\nShit, motherfucker. That whole verse was motherfuckin' whack\nIf miracles aren't fake you'll get off this motherfuckin' track\nEven if you motherfucked over Hinata and his class\nWe know you'd motherfuckin' love to have his fingers in your ass\n\nI've had enough of this clown's jugglery, no matter how high you get you're under me\nIn summary, I'll leave you under siege. Harpoon ya like your goat daddy underseas\nLeave you and your tacky clown crap like Chiaki. Crush every bone in your body\nThis kid is depraved so I'll mimic Dave and end your Insane Clown Posse\n\nYour shenanigans are weak man, I motherfuckin' top em\nSeems this motherfucker's more suited to be \"Ultimate Bottom\"\nLeaving you subjugglated, ain't you a motherfuckin' sucker\nI didn't even need to sober up to beat you, motherfucker",

I had a lot of fun writing all this parts, although it's been quite hard sometimes. You can expect more prog rock songs like these in the future. Thank you all for listening."

Welcome, this is me.\n\n[[track:jailstuck-intro|-JAILSTUCK (INTRO)-]]\nRJ!: That was Nick Smalley, uh, I am Robert J! Lake, uh...\nJit: And... I'm Jit.\nGFD: And nobody knows who I am.\nNick: That's GFD.\nJit: Yeah.\nRJ!: Luke Benjamins.\nGFD: Sup.\nRJ!: And this is [[album:jailbreak-vol-1|Jailbreak]] we're listening to right now.\nNick: It's a good album, man.\nJit: Yeah.\nRJ!: It's a really good album, it's all chiptunes.\nGFD: Almost.\nNick: Almost all chiptunes, I mean— RJ!: Mostly chiptunes. Nick: —some of us skipped out and cheated, you know, unlike me and GFD here, we were authentic.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: I don't know how to authentic chiptunes, I uh, made a compromise with myself that all of the sounds I used are going to be synthesized chiptunes. So, it's all not edited. It's all as chiptune as I can make it.\nNick: That's alright. I mean, things like this. It's pretty good.\nGFD: I don't remember hearing this track before.\nRJ!: This is one of the ones that I didn't upload ever.\nGFD: Oh.\nRJ!: This is [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]].\nNick: That's totally fine.\nGFD: I like this one.\nNick: It's got a cool vibe. Jit: Yeah, it's cool, I guess.\nRJ!: Yeah, this is the intro, and then the next one is... what the intro leads into.\nNick: That makes sense.\nRJ!: Mhmm.\nJit: Wait, wait, is this intro done now or...?\nRJ!: No. Jit: I have no idea, oh, okay.\nRJ!: You got— Jit: Yeah, I don't think I've actually listened to a lot of this stuff, or I've listened to it and then just kinda: you'll file it away without remembering any about it. So, it's like I'm listening to this for the first time too!\nGFD: I only listened to the stuff that was in the Google Doc, recently. And—\nNick: Yeah, I haven't listened to it recently.\n\n[[track:title-screen|-TITLE SCREEN-]]\nGFD: —and from a long time ago, when I got a bunch of MP3s from everybody from the forums 'cause I can't the forums.\nRJ!: Mhmm.\nJit: Oh man...\nNick: Is this still [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]]? Jit: I love this percussion.\nGFD: Yes.\nRJ!: What?\nNick: [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]] is forever.\nRJ!: Uh, no no, this is after [[track:jailstuck-intro|Jailstuck]]. This is the main title.\nJit: Oh. Nick: Okay. Press start to play... slash die.\nRJ!: Yeah.\nNick: Man, [imitates beat of the song], this would go great with a pendulum song.\n[laughter]\nRJ!: Ah, it's not 174 BPM.\nNick: How much is it?\nRJ!: Uh... it's 15-... it's 150, 160 something in that area.\nNick: That's pretty close, we could do it.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's true. Jit: Yeah, you could just turn it up a little bit.\nRJ!: Yeah, mash that shit up.\nNick: I could do it.\nRJ!: [falsetto] This piece is a long time coming, augh, you don't understaaand.\nNick: It's me, pendulum, slam slam. That was a good song.  GFD: Okay...\nJit: Oh no, this track is ending. RJ!: And now, we got— Jit: What's next? GFD: Wow, what?\nRJ!: Now, it's uh... GFD. Jit: I hope it's not anything of mine.\nGFD: It's mine next?\n\n[[track:logorg|-LOGORG-]]\nGFD: Ah, here we go.\nNick: [[track:logorg|Logorg]].\nRJ!: [[track:logorg|Logorg]].\nGFD: The first track that's not— Jit: Oh yeah, this one's great. GFD: —the first one that's not RJ.\nRJ!: Yeah, I kind of accidentally became the album. Half of it.\nNick: Yeah, I know, because a lot of people didn't want to be on the album because, like \"ugh, chiptunes are so bad\".\nRJ!: And I was just like, oh my god, I love chiptunes. It's my thing.\nJit: Yeah, I just never got back around to being bored of my own...\nGFD: If, uh... You guys should listen to this one, the NSF, in VirtuaNES as well because it sounds pretty cool in that. For a lot of other [unintelligible]— Jit: \"Virtual NES\", what?\nGFD: —I'm talking to the people who listening to us doing the commentary.\nJit: Because I don't what \"Virtual NES\" is. Tell me, GFD!\nGFD: It's a NES emulator that also plays NSFs, and doesn't—\nRJ!: It'll be in the extras. It'll be in the extras for the people listening, I'll have a link to it.\nGFD: Yeah, yeah. It's one of the only NSF players that doesn't screw the song up because I like, used stuff you're not supposed to do in Famitracker— RJ!: He cheated. GFD: —to make it sound this way.\nGFD: I'm a cheater.\nJit: Oh... Yeah, well, I doubt RJ actually made anything in Famitracker, so yeah...\nRJ!: I have samples from Famitracker. GFD: Eeeh.\nJit: That doesn't count.\nRJ!: Yeah, it does.\nJit: That's like \"using a leaf\" versus \"sampling a leaf\".\n\n[[track:elf-shanty|-ELF SHANTY-]]\nGFD: Wait, whose song is this now?\nRJ!: Uh, this is the only one that AgentParsec [Note: [[artist:mark-j-hadley|Mark Hadley]]] has in the album, this is [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]].\nGFD: Oh, right! I forgot about this one.\nNick: That elf.\nGFD: I remember this one, this is catchy.\nRJ!: Mhmm. GFD: Do we have an NSF of this one either?\nRJ!: Uh, I don't think he NSF'd this one, I think this is fake. I'm not sure though.\nGFD: Oh... sad.\nJit: I don't know, that percussion sounds awfully familiar.\nGFD: No, this sounds... this sounds like it was made in Famitracker. Can we get an NSF from him before we release the album?\nRJ!: We'd have to talk to him, though. Um, I want to have released it today and we're burning the afternoon oil right now.\nGFD: Let's see if you can find him, 'cause... for, I want NSFs for this.\nRJ!: He's got a baby though, now.\nGFD: [incredulous] He's got a baby?\nNick: Yeah, he does have a baby— GFD: What's he—? Nick: —don't you remember? GFD: What's he—?\nRJ!: So, it'd kinda make things more...\nGFD: What's he—? Jit: The baby's probably like months old by this point.\nGFD: What's he doing making babies? He should be making music.\nNick: Don't you remember?\nGFD: Great, so now we don't have NSFs.\nRJ!: He was busy watching the Sesame Street YouTube, that's how it happened.\nGFD: Oh. Oh, I see.\nNick: He was trying to figure out how, and then he watched Sesame Street.\n[laughter] Nick: Topical!\nRJ!: That's real family entertainment right there.\nNick: I don't know, this doesn't sound like something in Famitracker.\nGFD: Yes, it does. (What are) you on?\nJit: Yeah, it does.\nNick: Fine, you win. GFD: And hasn't Parsec made stuff in Famitracker before?\nNick: [[Harlequin]]?\nGFD: Yeah, er, wait... Jit: [[Aggrieve]]?\nGFD: Was it him that made the [[track:problem-sleuth-theme|title screen for Problem Sleuth]]?\nNick: Yes. GFD: Because that was in... that was in Famitracker.\nJit: It would make sense.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's probably him. Nick: In fact, if it weren't for Parsec, I wouldn't be on the music team.\nRJ!: Really? GFD: Really?\nNick: Uh huh.\nGFD: How did he, you, the music team?\nNick: Because I heard the [[track:problem-sleuth-theme|Problem Sleuth opening theme]] and I was like, I could do that.\nGFD: Ah.\nNick: And then, I sent music to Andrew and then he invited me into the music team [unintelligible].\nGFD: I don't even know how I got in. I literally have no idea. Jit: Yeah, me either.\nGFD: I was just, sort of, there all of a sudden... And then I wasn't, waaah.\nJit: Well, you like, applied at one point, I'm sure.\nGFD: Oh yeah, but I don't even remember if I put music in that email, actually.\n[laughter]\nRJ!: I'm here because Adghar [Note: Andrew Huo]...\nJit: Did the three of us like, \"I can make music\" and then you got in, and were just like \"I'm not making any music, right now.\"\nRJ!: I really wish I actually like, actively applied. I'm only here because, um, Adghar posted a bunch of people who were apparently like supposed... You know, music team candidates. Possible people. He listed me as um, \"psychedelic rock\".\nNick: Cool. Jit: Interesting.\n\n[[track:phantom-echoes|-PHANTOM ECHOES-]]\nNick: I love this song, oh my god.\nRJ!: Me too! Jesus Christ, it reminds me of Cave Story to uh, [unintelligible]. Is this done in PxTone?\nGFD: No, uh, the percussion... Jit: It sounds like it was in PxTone.\nGFD: Is the whole thing in PxTone? I thought it was like...\nRJ!: This sounds a lot like PxTone.\nGFD: Ah... that explains it.\nNick: It sounds a lot like it'd be in PxTone.\nGFD: [imitating song]\nNick: Yeah, you don't get that uh... sine wave in anything but, like, PxTone.\nGFD: Yee.\nRJ!: It's... Ohhh my goddd!\n[laughter]\nJit: Who made this one?\nRJ!: This is, uh, [noises] vavoom! Adghar, right?\nNick: Yeah. RJ!: That's Adghar.\nGFD: Yeah.\nJit: I don't remember him making stuff in ages.\nGFD: The OTHER Andrew H. Jit: He's pretty old.\n[laughter]\nGFD: He made two songs for this one, didn't he? ...no, three. One is the bonus track.\nNick: This is Andrew Hussie's Asian doppelganger. [laughter]\nRJ!: The one who plays violin. Jit: Yeah, the one that never actually like, makes hardly anything.\nNick: I agree.\nRJ!: Well, he's still definitely around. I mean, he gave me— This is a fresh WAV.\nNick: Yeah, this is like hot off the presses.\nJit: Cool. Nick: [imitating newspaper machine noises] RJ!: Yeah.\nJit: I mean, I know he still hangs around and such, but...\nGFD: I mean, he was definitely active for the \"Doctor Space\" thing that never happened.\nRJ!: We can't talk about that, can we?\nGFD: We can't? Nick: No.\nGFD: Oh, okay. I never said anything.\nRJ!: That's a tantalizing, tantalizing behind-the-scenes tidbit you all got there, guys.\nGFD: Yeah.\nJit: Yeah, \"Doctor Space\" is just like Doctor...\nRJ!: Never happened. Jit: In space.\nNick: It's an animated series like Dr. House, but it's in space.\n[collective laughter]\nGFD: I feel like that would be better than what we had it as.\nRJ!: No more talking. Jit: Okay.\n\n[[track:assail-jailbreak|-ASSAIL-]]\nNick: I love this one.\nRJ!: I love this one too. Hi, Jit.\nNick: Forget everything else, this song's the best.\nJit: Hi... yeah... it's like— RJ!: This is one of my favorites.\nGFD: Jit, how did— Jit: It's like, god, this thing is so freaking old. This is before Dave had a fight theme, and I was like, \"I'll try making one\".\nRJ!: I actually wish this was the fight theme over [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]].\nNick: Mmm.\nGFD: Jit— Jit: I don't know, [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]] was cool though.\nGFD: How do you feel about—  Jit: It's just like... RJ!: [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]], I like... I like [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]] but... I like this more.\nGFD: Jit, how do you feel about yourself when you listen to this?\nJit: Um... Nick: Probably the same way you feel about how you listen to your stuff.\nGFD: I feel amazing.\nJit: It's like... I don't know, I think it could've been better 'cause Famitracker could do a whole lot more as evidenced by like, [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]]. But it kinda shows like my inexperience with the whole thing in general.\nRJ!: But, I don't like [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]] as much as this.\nNick: I don't like [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]]. It's not my favorite. Jit: Oh you shut your face. You shut your face, RJ.\nRJ!: It's true, though, this is awesome and I kinda... Like, I look at [[track:pumpkin-cravings|Pumpkin Cravings]] as this weird little, kind of off-side thing that's not as good as Beatfox's [Note: Seth Peelle] other stuff.\nNick: Yeah.\nJit: Have you seen the Famitracker file for it though? It's crazy.\nRJ!: That doesn't make it good, that just means it has mental problems.\n[collective laughter]\nJit: Yeah, I mean crazy awesome— RJ!: I don't care.\nJit: —I mean the music is just great too, it's like \"Oh, great, this Jit guy, he's got a triangle\"... No, it was like a square doing the bassline and some really sparse electronic... noise drums, and the other square doing the melody. And then the triangle comes in, and it's arpeggios!\nRJ!: Oh my godddd, yes! Jit: Oh, woah!\nRJ!: It's gorgeous, it's simple, but it's gorgeous. Jit: You got this crazy shit right there, I mean, Jesus.\nGFD: It sets itself apart, it is, uh... I don't know what it is.\nJit: Yeah, I think this is like the first thing I ever made in Famitracker too.\nRJ!: I've never made anything in Famitracker, so you're still beating me in that regard.\nGFD: This is still better than the first things I made in Famitracker.\nRJ!: It's...\nNick: Yeah, you tell me, this is like, way better than what I started out with.\nGFD: RJ, haven't you watched my Famitracker tutorial yet?\nRJ!: Haven't had the time, I'm more busy than... I'm busier than God. GFD: It's only... it's only an hour. It's only an hour.\nRJ!: I know, and I'm busier than God as I just said.\nGFD: God has all the time in the world, though. Literally.\nNick: Woah, what the hell was that?\n\n[[track:confrontation-jailbreak|-CONFRONTATION-]]\nGFD: Oh, here we go.\nJit: This is— RJ!: [bad song imitation] Jit: —more Adghar. RJ!: Yeah, definitely.\nNick: So, what is this? GFD: Me and RJ were part, were inspirations for the song, a little bit. You can hear quotes from some of my songs that had never actually been out ever. Uh...\nRJ!: Am I really an inspiration for this, because I was listening to it and I didn't notice.\nGFD: Uh— Nick: Wait, what was the inspiration? GFD: —Andrew H. took like two really, really frickin' old tracks that I made a long time ago.\nRJ!: He said it was Jade inspired and I guess, would that mean that there's some, um... Wait... I'm listening right now... I can't notice any uh, if there's some [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] in here.\nGFD: Isn't it [[Gardener]] that's in here?\nRJ!: That's what [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of So]]—, yeah, yeah. GFD: Wait. I don't know my Homestuck songs very well.\nRJ!: [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]] is the original, um, it's the same melody as in [[Gardener]]. [[Gardener]] is just the thing that Steve Everson took and he took mine, and put it to a fake bass sample.\nGFD: Oh.\nRJ!: Yeah... But it's the same melody, the original is [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Beginning of Something Really Excellent]], but it's easier to call it [[Gardener]] so just do that. He gave it the name.\nGFD: It was, oh, we skipped over that part already. The minor part back there was inspired by \"eerie.mp3\" if anybody remembers that from me.\nRJ!: I don't.\nGFD: No, nobody does.\nJit: I think I have that in my computer somewhere.\nRJ!: You should give it to me so I can remix it.\nJit: I kind of store everything I ever download Homestuck and I put it in like a, in a folder on my computer.\nRJ!: The [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]] artwork is scaring me. Jit: It's some old stuff and there is that one song that Bowman made for the Crowsprite that never got used.\nGFD: Awh... Anybody remember [[track:mechanic-panic|Mechanic Panic]]?\nRJ!: Yes.\nJit: Yeah, I think I have that one on my computer too— RJ!: That didn't make it onto this album, sadly. [Note: It's actually in the bonus tracks!]\nGFD: I know, it was one of the very first songs that I remember from the forums... when Andrew was like \"Here, make a boss battle song.\"\n\n[[track:rising-water-oh-shit|-RISING WATER (OH, SHIT!)-]]\nNick: What is this?\nRJ!: Here's Slunk [Note: Paige Turner].\nGFD: Ah, yeah. Nick: Oh, Slunk...\nRJ!: [[track:rising-water-oh-shit|Rising Water (Oh, Shit!)]]\nGFD: And unfortunately, we lost the Famitracker files, so we don't have an NSF of this one either. And we cry.\nRJ!: Yeah, this art is really scaring me now.\nGFD: Are you still drawing this? What are you drawing now?\nRJ!: I'm still drawing— [[track:elf-shanty|Elf Shanty]]. GFD: Oh. Oh, boy.\nNick: That silly... Oh man, this is a high quality clip.\nRJ!: Isn't it?\nNick: Dude, yeah.\nRJ!: The highest quality.\nNick: I didn't know you could actually mess up the quality on a NSF file.\nJit: Really, what? GFD: What?\nJit: I'm not sure what you're talking about, I'm not versed in... That stuff... Nick: Not like... music quality, I'm talking about sound quality.\nRJ!: Yeah. Jit: Oh.\nNick: But hey, who's complaining?\nJit: Oh god, that frickin' rising water! [shivering noises]\nJit: Oh, dear god. RJ!: Oh, shit!\nGFD: And then there was the glub at the end.\n\n[[track:moment-of-pause|-MOMENT OF PAUSE-]]\nGFD: And now, what's this? What is this track? What IS this track?\nRJ!: This is the pause theme. GFD: Oh, yes, this is the one you made—\nRJ!: While mastering the album. GFD: WHILE you were mastering the album.\nGFD: Yes, while mastering, because you needed a transition.\nRJ!: And it wouldn't work, yeah. GFD: Ya weirdo.\nGFD: Oh well, it's not as bad as me finishing... Eh, actually, no, it is worse than me finishing a song three days before the album, so what am I talking about.\nJit: Hey, I only put up like, my WAVs last night 'cause I was like, \"uhhh, something going on with this?\"\n[collective laughter] Jit: \"Oh, I should get my WAVs then. Here you go.\" GFD: Did you know this was being released today?\nJit: ...No? [collective laughter] Jit: Not really, no. GFD: Man...\nJit: 'Cause Radiation [Note: ...Toby Fox] was like, \"I think I'll hold it off until after the end of acts\" and I was like...\nRJ!: When did he say that?\nJit: He said it on the forums or something.\nGFD: Well... RJ!: Wait, wait.\nJit: As if he was the one who was deciding when it went out too, was weird. GFD: Uh, well...\nRJ!: Yeah, that's kind of... scary.\nGFD: Well, that's not happening anymore.\nJit: Whatever... No, screw him.\nRJ!: He says publicly, for the public record.\n[laughter] Jit: Yeah. Screw [[Black]] too.\n[laughter] Nick: Yeah, how 'bout that— GFD: Yeh. Nick: —Radiation, or should I say... mmMMMmGAYdiation.\nJit: Does he even have any tracks on this album?\nRJ!: No, he does not have any tra—\n\n[[track:bars-jailbreak|-BARS-]]\nGFD: Oh, here's [[track:bars-jailbreak|Bars]]. Here's [[track:bars-jailbreak|Bars]] coming on.\nRJ!: I made this. Yeah, I made this.\nGFD: Yeah, RJ made this and I helped a little bit, except actually the whole song was me the whole time! You didn't expect that, did you?\nRJ!: Why was that so funny to you? Jit: Was it really all you?\nGFD: I don't know, it's hilarious, okay?\nRJ!: I posted... I'm not even going to explain the joke.\nGFD: Yeah, okay, it's just a joke, okay? Uh, yeah, this was the one I finished three days before this came out. 'Cause I'm like, wait, I have this song idea, I'm gonna make it. I still have two other song ideas that are kind of Jailbreak-y, but I just, I don't have time to do them. So, I'm just going to leave them for something else. Maybe my EP that I still want to make.\nRJ!: Ooh, you should do an EP. GFD: I know. RJ!: I would buy it. GFD: I know. RJ!: I would buy it.\nGFD: It's going to be like yours, five years in the making.\nRJ!: Nice. Except mine's an LP.\nGFD: Oh. Well... Screw you.\nRJ!: Please do.\nGFD: This is my favorite part. Jit: Is this...\nRJ!: Yes. Jit: Is this the same song then? Or...\nRJ!: Yeah, it's got a long pause.\nGFD: Yeah. It's suspenseful, and artistic. I like silence in music.\nJit: That's not artistic—\n\n[[track:jackknive|-JACKKNIVE-]]\nJit: —oh, this is the new song, now.\nNick: The new song.\nJit: I still remember this one, it's not even called \"Jackknife\" on my computer. It's called, uh, what is it... \"idea 6 chiptune\".\nRJ!: Well, it's called \"JackKniVeFe\" on the actual album.\nJit: Yeah, I'm not sure if you actually end it with \"ve\" or \"fe\"— wait, you're not actually calling it that are you?\nGFD: He is. RJ!: No, I am. I am.\nJit: No, nonono no, put it as \"ve\".\nRJ!: No, it's uh... I'm gonna write, read this out to you, letter by letter: \"J-a-c-k-K-n-i-F-e-V-e\".\nJit: But no... [laughter] RJ!: Yes.\nGFD: That's what I told him, don't do that.\nRJ!: Serious— Jit: No... RJ!: N— Yes. Jit: No! No no, you can't do that. That's not your decision.\nRJ!: It isn't my decision? Well, technically, it is my decision, but it isn't my decision. If you really want me to change it, I will. That's what it is right now, though.\nGFD: I think he really wants you to change it.\nJit: Yeah... No, it's just because... I was kinda of typing in all caps last night, so you can't really take... I don't think you should try to be taking anything I said last night in the doc very seriously.\nNick: Oh, we're going to. Don't worry.\nJit: I mean, I was like \"AHH JIT'S HERE. I'M GONNA GO GET SOME COKE WHILE THIS STUFF UPLOADS, YEAH!\"\nRJ!: How HIGH were you?\nJit: I was... I'm never high. I'm just...\nGFD: And then, you deleted my amazing poetry. You jerk.\nJit: That wasn't poetry. GFD: Yes, it was.\nJit: No, it wasn't. GFD: It was quality poetry.\nJit: Was not. [laughter]\nJit: I'll give you a quality poetry: \"Roses are red, violets are blue... GFD is stupid, and so is poo.\" RJ!: \"And fuck you!\"\nNick: Woah!\nJit: No, you can't interrupt. RJ!: I co-opted on your god damn poetry into my own.\nGFD: Shut... Shut.\nNick: I didn't realize this whole album was 42 minutes long.\nGFD: It is. RJ!: You didn't?\nGFD: We're not even halfway. Nick: No. I know...\nRJ!: The scary thing is that half of it is mine, which means I wrote 20 minutes of chiptunes for this album.\nNick: I wrote two. GFD: The other scary thing is that this call has been going for like, two hours, fifteen minutes before we started recording.\nRJ!: Yeeah, that's kinda bad. Jit: Yeeah.\nGFD: Half an hour of that us trying to find us a safe failsafe before recording. Jit: Was not, you're just...\nRJ!: Which we never did. GFD: No. I really hope Vegas doesn't crash.\nJit: I've sorta got one going, but I'm not sure how it's working.\nGFD: What?\nJit: I mean, it's recording the music too. GFD: Oh.\nJit: So I have to have my music kinda low. GFD: Oh.\nRJ!: I just realized I accidentally, like subconsciously drew this elf as Sweet Bro. [laughter]\nRJ!: Oh, no no, it's Hella Jeff. Hella Jeff's the one with the 8^y mouth. Jit: Keep it! Keeeep it.\nRJ!: I'm keeping it, no, don't worry. Jit: Good boy.\n\n[[track:intestinal-fortification|-INTESTINAL FORTIFICATION-]]\nGFD: Okay, wait, what's this one?\nRJ!: Um, uh, this is right after... This is [[track:intestinal-fortification|Intestinal Fortification]]. This is also Slunk.\nGFD: Oh, this is also Slunk. Another one we don't have an NSF for. Oh, that percussion's nice.\nNick: I like it. RJ!: I like it.\nGFD: This is the song that represents all the blood, and mud, and... stuff.\nNick: Woaah...\nJit: And all the poo [unintelligible]. RJ!: This has a genuinely terrifying art that he did for it.\nNick: But... huh...\nRJ!: Because, for his art, um, for the album art he did for his own tracks, or her own tracks, her/his, he uh, she, um... The art Slunk did for the tracks is really like hyper-realistic. I mean, not hyper-realistic, but like, these scary realistic renditions of the Jailbreak characters doing the same actions.\nJit: What do you mean hyper-realistic? RJ!: Not hyper— Well...\nJit: I don't think I've actually seen... RJ!: It's not actually hyper-realistic— GFD: Now we're halfway.\nRJ!: —it's actually kind of cartoon-y. GFD: We hit halfway.\nRJ!: But, it's um... Relative to the stick figures in the actual comic, it's realistic, and it's terrifying.\nGFD: Then [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]] was amazing.\nRJ!: It's like nightmare, nightmare-ish. It's yeah, then [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], uh um, [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]] is, [blubbering] It's good.\nJit: I don't think—\nRJ!: I'll agree with that.\nGFD: I still know how this song goes, even though I haven't heard it in ages. It is— Nick: Very memorable. GFD: —it is that. RJ!: It is. GFD: Yes, it is memorable.\nRJ!: I like both of Slunk's tracks here a lot, in a completely different way from the rest of the album.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: They're both really, um... I don't know how to descri— I don't know an adjective that's perfect for it.\nGFD: Slunk-y.\nRJ!: That's perfect.\nGFD: Exactly. And it's over.\n\n[[track:console-thunder|-CONSOLE THUNDER-]]\nGFD: And now, this is the stereo track. He made this one in— RJ!: Stere—\nJit: Yeah, I just, I so suddenly noticed that.\nGFD: Yeah, because RJ is... suddenly, this one's on a Game Boy... or something.\nNick: Heh.\nJit: Did Game Boy's have ste— GFD: They did! They had stereo, uh, sound. RJ!: Well—\nJit: I could never notice that 'cause, uh...\nGFD: Yeah, the speaker had stereo sound. RJ!: They did have stereo sound. They in fact, it's advertised as such on them. Like, the Game Boy itself.\nGFD: Yeah. Dot matrix with stereo sound. RJ!: As having stereo sound. Yep! ...but yeah, I cha—\nJit: How do you remember those things about a Game Boy, like were you playing games on them or were you just studying the manuals in games.\nRJ!: It says that on the Game Boy itself. GFD: Right under the screen. Or above it. RJ!: Yeah, literally. GFD: Yeah.\nJit: Well, shut...\nGFD: So, you can't really avoid that one.\nJit: [mocking noises] Yeah, you can if you're me.\nRJ!: Clearly. GFD: Well, you're a dingus.\nNick: Woah... Jit: I'm not a dingus! Nick: Are you going to take that back? That's not nice.\nGFD: No.\nRJ!: Never call somebody a genius to their face.\nGFD: No, I said dingus.\nRJ!: You called someone a genius to their Skype.\nJit: He said dingus.\nRJ!: I don't care. [laughter]\nJit: Oh, I just found a battery!\nNick: Woah. Jit: Thrilling commentary by Jit. I'm sorry, I'm just like, \"Oh, woah, a battery.\"\nRJ!: Let's talk about batteries for a while.\nGFD: No! Jit: It's those little ones that you stick into laser pointers and Tamagotchis.\nRJ!: For a lot of this album, I cheated because I'm mixing very different kinds of soundchips together. They're all 8-bit, but I have a Sega PSG here, along with a Nintendo emulation and a Game Boy emulation, like there's a bunch of different things for a lot of them.\nGFD: Strange. I like the stereo sound here, even though it's not... uh... Jit: It's not appropriate.\nNick: It's not Kosher.\nJit: RJ, you're not supposed to be showing that sort of stereo graphic sound in here.\nGFD: It's not straight-bit, that's the phrase I'm stealing from RJ. RJ!: I like... I liked yeah, how nobody said that about Phantom Echoes even though that was stereo too.\nGFD: It was stereo? Nick: But that one was cooler.\nGFD: It wasn't as... RJ!: [fake laughter] Yeah, it was. Actually, though, it is cooler than this one.\nGFD: It wasn't dramatic about its stereo. It wasn't throwing it in your face. RJ!: That's true, all of my stereo tracks are very stereo.\nGFD: Yes. [imitating song]\nRJ!: Is it enervating yet?\nJit: I don't know... What's enervating mean?\nRJ!: Irritating, but um, yeah. Jit: Oh, no. You can never be irritating.\nRJ!: I'm irritating, I'm pretty irritating.\nGFD: RJ is fucking annoying!\nRJ!: It's true. GFD: But fucking irritating as what your Skype used to be.\nRJ!: Yeah. GFD: But now, you're a gigantic fucking eye and fuck.\nRJ!: For everyone who has added me on Skype, they already know that, but it's true.\nGFD: Yes.\nJit: Awshi... Sorry, I dropped something. GFD: Because of the one time I went to chat you, and then your display picture was a gigantic eye and that's what I said: \"a gigantic fucking eye and fuck.\"\nRJ!: I actually... I know. GFD: Because it scared the crap out of me, okay? That thing was huge.\nRJ!: It's just a—\n\n[[track:be-the-other-guy|-BE THE OTHER GUY-]]\nJit: —okay, wait, I don't remember this one, what is this?\nRJ!: Uh, this is \"With Bros\".\nGFD: Is it still going to be called that? Nick: \"With Bros\".\nRJ!: Probab— Jit: Ohh, PerryBob [Note: Perry Sullivan].\nGFD: He says [unintelligible] change the title. RJ!: Probably... I can change the title and I probably will, it was originally \"With Friends\", that's most likely what it's going to be but... I don't know.\nGFD: It's going to be \"With Friends\" again?\nRJ!: \"With Friends Again\", that's actually... No no, wait... I don't know.\nNick: How about \"[[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]\"? Jit: Man, you know, I wish [[track:mannequin|Mannequin]] was on this album.\nRJ!: [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]] is actually a perfect title.\nGFD: [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The]]— Jit: Actually, now that I'm suddenly thinking about it, [[track:mannequin|Mannequin]] should be on this album.\nRJ!: Well, you can't change that now because the track list has already been mastered and finalized.\nGFD: Hah! Jit: Yeah, I know. GFD: Hah.\nRJ!: And we're commenting on it.\nJit: I am the master of being late, I've noticed this recently like, someone will tell me to do something or I'll be like \"Oh, I should do this thing for someone\" and then I won't get to it for months and months.\nGFD: Ha, yeah, how lo— how old is that Jailbake thread that I made in the music enclave now?\nRJ!: Probab— GFD: Which is still [intelligible] that you guys used apparently.\nRJ!: Well, uh, I don't know how exactly how old it is, but a good metric is the fact that Andrew said that we were probably going to be releasing this album sometime in July. [laughter]\nGFD: Oh, good times...\nJit: Yeah, really.\nGFD: This is so catchy.\nJit: Oh, for some reason, I'm just like, looking through my desk while we talk. I don't know why.\nRJ!: Multitasking! [song imitation noises]\nJit: Not really. Maybe it's just like a natural part of the... [song imitation noises]\nGFD: I like this song.\nJit: What?\nRJ!: I do too.\nJit: I like lots of stuff that PerryBob does.\nRJ!: PerryBob and Tyler Deververver... Dedever... the Dever [Note: James Dever].\nJit: Dever?\nRJ!: Mister Sburb.\nGFD: Jit, I don't actually know how to pronounce your last name.\nRJ!: Scheele.\nGFD: Scheele?\nJit: What? Yeah, yeah, it's Scheele.\nGFD: Interesting.\nRJ!: But yeah, um... Jit: It's German, it's does—\nGFD: That's not even a pronoun— Nick: Is it still [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]?\nGFD: This isn't, that's not even a pronounciation that I imagined while thinking about the ones it could be. Nick: I'm just going to assume this is still \"[[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]]\".\nJit: What, were you thinking it was like \"Ski-lee\" or something?\nGFD [unintelligible] \"Skeel\". RJ!: Have we decided then, this track is now called [[track:be-the-other-guy|Be The Other Guy]] then? I like that.\nGFD: Okay. I thought it was like \"Sch-keele\" or something.\nNick: Scheele. It's German.\nGFD: Fine. You're German?\nJit: At least it's... Uh... I don't actually know.\nNick: The name is German. Jit: I think I'm more of Dutch nowadays, but old German.\nGFD: Interesting.\nJit: Like, the name is definitely German, but I think my grandfather is Dutch.\nGFD: Can you swear at us in German?\nJit: Uh... I don't think so. GFD: Aw...\nJit: I don't actually know much German at all, I'd like repeating lines from TF2 or something. [laughter]\nNick: [bad Heavy imitation] \"Go ahead and cry, baby!\"\nRJ!: Yeah, Jesus Christ Superstar, this is scary art. Jit: That's a Heavy [unintelligible].\nRJ!: What am I doing?\nGFD: RJ, what are you doing?\nJit: Hey, Jesus Christ Superstar is... RJ!: No, I'm saying the Elf Shanty art is really terrifying.\nGFD: Okay, uh... Nick: It should be.\nJit: Yeah, the elves are terrifying in Jailbreak, they aren't like the nice ones in Problem Sleuth. These ones are like \"Hey, you want our help?\" \"Take this as a warning, and go away.\"\nRJ!: No, I'm just saying I made this elf look kind of like Venom from Spider-Man. [laughter]\nGFD: What? Jit: Oh, nice. I like that idea. GFD: No, I don't know how you did that, I'm trying to imagine this piece of art and I can't do it. My brain doesn't work that way.\nRJ!: It's the tongue. Jit: It's probably an elf with the— RJ!: It has the Venom tongue.\nJit: Yeah.\n\n[[track:softbit|-SOFTBIT-]]\nGFD: Wait, what song is this? I've never heard this.\nRJ!: This is [[track:softbit|Softbit]].\nGFD: This is [[track:softbit|Softbit]]?!\nRJ!: Yeeah, man. Nick: [unintelligible] RJ!: I completely rechanged it, reworked it, whatever. Words.\nGFD: Holy crap! This is really... this sounds like something from Cave Story now!\nGFD: It IS from Cave Story, you just took a song from Cave Story and stuck it in the album, you jerk. Nick: I like it a lot.\nRJ!: Yeah, I did, I'm sorry. Nick: Yeah, good job, now we can't sell this.\nRJ!: Copyright Studio Pixekel. It's not like we haven't done that before. Nick: Pixekel? GFD: Pixel.\nRJ!: Pik, Pick, Pic Skull. Nick: No, don't say it, don't say it.\nJit: Is this really from Cave Story?\nGFD: No, it's not. RJ!: No, it's not actually from Cave Story. Jit: Okay, good.\nGFD: Just like RJ actually made [[track:bars-jailbreak|Bars]]. [laughter] Oh, wait... Man, it's missing all the oomph that it used to have. It's all uh—\nRJ!: It's more...  Nick: YOU'RE missing the oomph. RJ!: Softer than—\nGFD: It's wimpier.\nNick: You're wimpier.\nRJ!: It's softer.\nJit: Wait... this melody sounds familiar GFD: It does. RJ!: I wonder, is it because I wrote it?\n[laughter] GFD: Why did you redo this song?\nRJ!: I didn't like it before. GFD: Can you upload the old version as a bonus track, 'cause I liked it that way.\nRJ!: OOOOKAY... GFD: Okay. Nick: No! GFD: Yes.\nRJ!: But only because, I'm gonna call it: \"[[track:softbit-original-gfd-please-shut-the-fuckass-mix-by-request-demo-version|Softbit (GFD's Surprise Mix)]]\". [laughter]\nNick: \"[[track:softbit-original-gfd-please-shut-the-fuckass-mix-by-request-demo-version|Softbit (This is Why I Changed it Remix)]]\". [laughter]\nGFD: Excellent.\nJit: I swear this sounds familiar, like it's a Homestuck track.\nRJ!: Because it is a Homestuck track!\nGFD: It is, it's the...\nRJ!: It's, uh, it's a rearrangement of [[track:softly|Softly]] from Volume 5 that I wrote.\nJit: Oh, okay... I hardly remember that track, unfortunately.\nRJ!: It's okay, most people don't remember my songs. [fake sniffles]\nJit: I doubt most people remember my songs either, but I mean, Volume 5 was massive.\nGFD: I doubt anybody LISTENED to my songs.\nNick: People listened to my song on Volume 5.\n[song imitation noises]\nGFD: No, you know what, nono, no, this is, like, this is one... The difference between your old version of this song and the new one is like, the old Cave Story soundtrack to the new one on WiiWare. That's the difference.\nRJ!: That was mean. You're mean. You're being mean to me.\nGFD: It, it's, it's, it is, that is how it sounds like, even some of the instruments sound the same.\nJit: Wait, are you saying this one's the new one or?\nGFD: The new one.\nJit: Oh... you're mean. GFD And.— RJ!: That was mean.\nJit: I don't even know what the new soundtrack is, but, I mean...\nGFD: It's okay.\nJit: It's like thinking about the new Spelunky soundtrack or something because I played the original and I played this great mod of it called \"Tastes Like Spelunky\". And then it's like, oh, there's a new one! And I'm like, oh great, will Buzinkai do the music? [growling] Nooo.\nGFD: What just happened to your voice?\nNick: [imitating growl] Nooo. GFD: It sounded really scary on this end.\nRJ!: It sounded like when I used effects with DigiTech, with my DigiTech vocalist.\nJit: That's just me, going all deep in voice for some—\n[everyone imitating growl] [laughter]\nJit: 'Cause I mean. Oh, I dunno. I get this feeling that I don't actually know how high my voice is normally, but I can go pretty low.. 'cause I'm like, a bass, in choir speak.\nGFD: My voice. My voice is just weird, I hate it.\nJit: Yeah, I hate my voice too. I tried to record some singing the other day—\n\n[[track:drillgorg|-DRILLGORG-]]\nNick: Yes. GFD: Yes, here we go. Jit: Oh man, I love this, [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]], yes! RJ!: Me too! Me too. GFD: Woo! This is all me!\nRJ!: We're in the ending stretch of the album, right now. This is good. Jit: Are we?\nGFD: TSN [Note: Nick Smalley] helped with instrumentation on this one.\nNick: And volumes. Good lord, the volumes.\nGFD: Yeah, 'cause the percussion was kind of overpowering before.\nJit: Oh man, this one's [[track:drillgorg|Drillgorg]].\nGFD: Yes, yeah it is. Jit: I even remember the title, yes. RJ!: Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is. I love this one.\nGFD: TSN also had the idea for the lovely DPCM samples.\nRJ!: That's perfect by the way, don't change a thing. GFD: I know.\nJit: I don't even know what that is.\nNick: Oh, the changing the echo?\nGFD: Oh, Jit, you haven't heard the voices in this one yet?\nJit: No... what? GFD: Well, let's— RJ!: Um— GFD: We had to—\nGFD: Hold on, everyone be quiet, it's coming up right now. [shush] RJ!: Okay. GFD: Let him hear it.\n[lyrics kick in] Jit: Oh, yeah, I know this one. GFD: Oh.\nRJ!: The atypical thing about this album is that, for the first time I think, the one who's not shoehorning voice samples in the album is not me. [laughter]\nJit: Hey, you do good things with voice samples though.\nNick: Shut up!\nJit: Well, let's see, who does shoehorn voice samples in? There's RJ, Bowman I guess, I can think of Radiation...\nGFD: [[track:mayor-maynot|Mayor Maynot]]?\nRJ!: Boner boner bo-bo bo-boner boner!\nNick: Yeah, that was cute. Jit: Yeah and also [[track:gaia-queen|Gaia Queen]], uhh, and then, [unintelligible].\n\n[[track:retrobution|-RETROBUTION-]]\nGFD: Guys! Guys, [[track:retrobution|Retrobution]]!\nNick: Yes!\nJit: Oh, man, the other great one!\nNick: It's the good one.\nRJ!: Fucking hell that melody, Jesus Christ.\nGFD: I helped TSN on this one, this time. A little bit of instrumentation, mostly the ending.\nNick: Mostly the ending.\nRJ!: Nick Smalley on a Game Boy.\nNick: That's me.\n[imitating song]\nJit: I can't even do cool stuff like this one anymore.\nNick: I was heading up— Jit: Did you make this in Famitracker?\nNick: Yeah, I made this in Famitracker.\nJit: Sweeeet.\nRJ!: It's soooo pretty.\nNick: Really?\nRJ!: You're pretty.\nNick: Oh, thanks. That's flattering.\n[laughter] Jit: You're all pretty people.\nGFD: Ah... except, except me. Jit: Pretty ponies and people.\nNick: I like how it slows down, it's my favorite part. Just this break.\nJit: Yeah, I've never been really dramatic like that with my stuff. I don't know, maybe I should try that out sometime.\nGFD: My favorite part is the ending. 'Cause I made it. RJ!: My favorite part is the whooole fuckiiing sooong.\nJit: My favorite part is the arpeggios at the beginning...\nGFD: Arpeggios! [imitating song]\nGFD: You just have to say arpeggios a lot. Jit: Yeah...\nRJ!: Arpeggios, arpeggi— d-yeah, I can't do that.\n[imitating song] RJ!: That works, that works. That's cheating, though.\nNick: I know.\nGFD: Here it comes. Oh wait, this is near the end. The climax of the song.\nRJ!: Kick drum.\nGFD: It's all bass heavy.\nNick: I like that.\nRJ!: Me too.\nNick: Heavy percussion is the best part.\nGFD: It was, it is DPCM percussion isn't it?\nNick: Yeah. GFD: Yeeaahh. That's good stuff.\nRJ!: I wonder how AgentParsec will feel about this Elf Shanty artwork.\nGFD: From here on, is where I help make the ending. Nick: I like the ending.\nGFD: It used to be such a cop-out ending.\nNick: Yeah, it was. [laughter]\nJit: What, was it a fade out or something?\nGFD: It used to, it would just do another slowdown and just sorta ended, but now it's this.\nRJ!: Yeah, but now it's awesome.\n[\"your mother\" part of \"retrobution\" plays]\n[collective laughter] Jit: Ahaha, what?\n\n[[track:game-over-jailbreak|-GAME OVER-]]\nJit: I don't remember the \"your mother\" part.\nNick: That's the best part.\nGFD: I just stuck it in at the end there and then TSN stretched it out hilariously.\n[laughter]\nJit: Yoouurr mootthherr.\nGFD: RJ, are you seriously going to do [[track:a-common-occurrance-every-night-to-be-exact|a bonus track]] by remixing the...?\nRJ!: Yeah, yeah I am.\n[laughter]\nGFD: You're hilarious.\nRJ!: Thank you, thank...\n\n[[track:is-this-the-end|-IS THIS THE END?-]]\nRJ!: I'm also planning on incorporating \"Your Bed\", the Bowman video.\nGFD: Yes, please.\nJit: Wait, the one, the \"IN HELL\" one or...\nRJ!: No, no no no. GFD: No.\nNick: \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\"\nGFD: No, not my YouTube Poop, it's the \"Your Bed\" video.\nJit: Ohh, the actual...\nGFD: Yes. RJ!: Yeah.\nGFD: Not one of my remixes. RJ!: By Bowman, yeah.\nGFD: I should finish my other one.\nJit: So what track is this? I recognize it, but I'm not sure.\nRJ!: Are you doing that on purpose? This is \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\"\nGFD: RJ, you changed this track again!\nRJ!: I just said, I said that too.\nJit: This track, \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\", this is the last track?\nRJ!: No, the last track is \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\".\nJit: Oh, you cheeky bastard.\nGFD: There's more stereo here.\nRJ!: There is, yeah.\nGFD: RJ. RJ!: So, from... Jit: [unintelligible]\nRJ!: What? Nick: Woah... GFD: What?\nGFD: I hate it when we all try to talk at the same time, and then nothing happens. Somebody say something.\nRJ!: Oh. Jit: Yeah.\nRJ!: Hi. My name is RJ. I made this track. I hope you like it.\nGFD: I helped.\nJit: Did you do anything special with this track?\nRJ!: Um, I... Stereo.\nJit: Why am I hearing samples that sound like someone going \"pschwoo\" or like, this sucking-in sound that's also expectorating and I'm not sure—\nRJ!: That's the, um... It's an NES noise channel with a negative, like... I don't know, what do you call it?\nGFD: This sounds different too.\nRJ!: Pitch. It's less crowded so it's much easier to listen to and not painful.\nJit: You know, it's funny nowadays, because you can almost like... The two tracks, [[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End]] and \"[[track:this-is-the-end|The End]]\", it's almost like Jailbreak is, or how it was. Because for the longest time, it just ended.\nRJ!: Yeah, it's true. Jit: With the horse going in and going to sleep. But then we actually had a legitimate end when Andrew linked to it.\nGFD: That is kinda funny, I never noticed that.\nJit: Yeah, so now it's like, oh, \"[[track:is-this-the-end|Is This the End?]]\" that's pre-updated and then, \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\", oh, the horse is going to sleep, okay. Nick: Oh.\nGFD: Zero score. I tried to click \"Do you want to play again?\" and then nothing happened, and I was sad.\nGFD: RJ.\nRJ!: Yeah.\nGFD: Aren't you so glad that I stayed up playing Doom and sent you a million voicemails to wake you up while you were fell asleep producing.\nRJ!: Yes, yes I am, actually.\n[laughter]\nJit: I wish I could do that to you. Just have your phone number and pester you.\nGFD: I just called him via Gmail and then—\nRJ!: You can have my phone number if you want it. It's not— GFD: It's in the— Jit: Wait, you can call people via Gmail?\nGFD: Yeah, you can set do free calls to the US and Canada.\nJit: Oh my god, really?\n[collective laughter]\nJit: I am so excited by this possibility.\nGFD: I'm trying to call Bowman but he never answers. RJ!: I'm gonna put tiny... I'm putting tiny stars inside of the elf's eyes.\nGFD: This track's pretty loud, for some reason. It just feels louder.\nRJ!: Really?\nGFD: Yeah, I don't know.\nRJ!: I can turn it down before the album goes out?\nGFD: Are you sure you're done mastering?\nRJ!: I am done mastering but like, I mean, individual tracks can be... still played with a little bit.\nJit: Oh, listen to that filter!\n\n[[track:this-is-the-end|-THIS IS THE END-]]\nJit: And now, \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\". Nick: [[track:is-this-the-end|Is this the end?]]\nRJ!: \"[[track:this-is-the-end|This is the End]]\".\nGFD: It's overrrr! Jit: This is really stereo.\nNick: That was good comments.\nGFD: I wonder if anybody's going to get the joke in Drillgorg.\nRJ!: I will drill your ass... GFD: Like how I will drill your ass is uh...\nJit: Oh my god, I suddenly get it! It's a reference to \"Rosenblatt\".\nGFD: Yes, it's a reference to \"Rosenblatt\".\nJit: Oh... BroHoster, what a great thing that is nowadays.\nNick: Yeah, that's why I put it there. Jit: Just to have...\nGFD: It's one of my favorite YTPMVs I've made. Jit: Wow.\nGFD: I should just make an album of YTMPVs or something. Nick: [loud bumps] Ahh! GFD: TSN, what did you just do?\nNick: I killed myself.\n[laughter]\nNick: There you have it, top notch quality commentating.\nRJ!: Is this still too loud, by the way? Like, compared to the other one?\nGFD: No, it's not.\nRJ!: Ok, good. So maybe I'll just have to fix the other one then if it's painfully loud.\nGFD: I like how we're doing the commentary, but we're still doing stuff for the album.\nRJ!: Well, it's because the album's not completely out yet.\nGFD: This is a really great release. RJ, how much sleep have you had working on this?\nRJ!: Uh, one and a half hours.\nGFD: My goodness gracious, no wonder your eye is so... RJ!: I'm to— I'm totally awake right now, actually. It's kind of incredible. I feel amazing.\nGFD: You are an incredible machine, but— RJ!: I am a machine.\nGFD: Let us all give thanks to RJ and his album that also a couple of other people helped with a little bit.\nRJ!: That sounds more like my— oh wait, I can't talk about what album I was just gonna talk about.\n[exaggerated gasping]\nNick: He must be some cool kid, trying to— RJ!: [sarcastic laughter] Yeah, I am. GFD: Such a cool kid.\nRJ!: I'm the coolest. Nick: RJ's really cool kid. He should have an album.\nGFD: Yeah.\nRJ!: I should.\nJit: Yeah, everyone should have an album. Nick: RJ should have a cool kid album.\nJit: Nick Smalley, you should have an album.\nRJ!: He's a pretty cool kid, too.\nGFD: Yeah. Me and Nick should make one. RJ!: The coolest. I'M THE COOLEST!\nNick: Let's all make an album. RJ!: What is that from? Wh-wh-wh— Oh, no, that's Sonic the Hedgehog, isn't that?\nJit: Haha, what? Nick: Yeah.\nRJ!: Yeah, that's Sonic the Hedgehog.\nJit: I'm not gonna have this... wait, is it done?\nNick: Yeah. Jit: No, it's not done yet!\nNick: That's— that's it!\nRJ!: That was the end of the album.\nGFD: It's overrrrrrrr!\nRJ!: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yep! It's over!\nNick: That was commentation...\nRJ!: That was commentary on [[album:jailbreak-vol-1|Jailbreak Vol. 1]], by Jailbreak.\nGFD: You're welcome.\nRJ!: I hope you enjoyed it. Nick: [deep voice] I hope you enjoyed it.\nJit: Yeah, next time it updates, we'll make a Volume 2 all about that one update.\n[collective laughter]—"

The song is based off of the ending portion of Hate You, starting at 2:11, which in turn was based off of the intro from [[track:love-you-feferis-theme|Love You]]. I took it out of hibernation and finished it for the update.\n\nThe weird name is a reference to Suikoden, a PlayStation RPG where you walk around talking to characters trying to recruit them into your army.

      "Commentary": "<i>LizaWithAZed:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis album means a lot to me, for a lot of reasons. Not just because it represents literally months of planning, organization, rounds of messaging, upsets, drama, triumph and general hard work on the part of me and some very good friends of mine. Not just because we managed to get some of the top talent in the fandom to contribute not only music but track art. Not just because that talent includes music and art team members and the uniquely universally beloved superfan [[artist:dante-basco]]. Not just because that talent also includes many friends I love dearly, some of whom I got to know through this project.\n\nNo, this album is special to me because the original [[album:lofam]] holds a very dear place in my heart. It was the first album of Homestuck-related music I ever owned. I played it over and over, and read the album commentary until I damn near had it memorized. It was LoFaM which spurred me to stop lurking on the MSPA forums and dive headlong into the collective insanity we call Homestuck fandom. And right when I did so coincided with the start of the second fanmusic thread, and a guy named [[artist:kevin-grant|Underwater Basketweaving]] posting something he called [[Fighting Spirit]]. I downloaded it, loved it, and have been hip deep in collecting fanmusic - not just that already collected for my convenience in an album - ever since.\n\nFighting Spirit is in here, and [[track:fighting-spirit-second-form|its sequel]], and many others I and my compatriots ran across in our scouring of not only the fanmusic thread but tindeck, soundcloud, tumblr and basically anywhere on the big wide internet where MSPA fans celebrate their love of this remarkable work of fiction through music.\n\nIt's my hope that, having gathered it all here for your convenience, you too are spurred to start your own search for the best, including many pieces that for one reason or another we had to leave off. The Land of Fans and Music is not just this 2-disc set or its predecessor; they're only the tip of the vast landscape of amazing talent. Come in. Explore. Get lost in it, like I did. I haven't regretted it for a second.\n\n*-Liza(WithAZed) Fletcher*\n\n<i>Unofficial MSPA Fans:</i> (booklet commentary, back)\n\n*Special Thanks:*\n\n<b>-CONCEPTION/ORGANIZATION-</b><br>\n[[artist:lambda-elise-merryberry]]<br>\n[[artist:lizawithazed]]\n\n<b>-ORGANIZATION TEAM-</b><br>\n[[artist:seth-massey|Slogbait]]<br>\n[[artist:veritas-unae]]<br>\n[[artist:rachel-rose-mitchell]]<br>\n[[artist:jamie-paige|Jamie 'hrmnzr\" Paige]]<br>\n[[artist:riki-tsuji]]<br>\n[[artist:clumsyroyalty|Sarah (clumsyroyalty)]]<br>\n[[artist:shoona]]<br>\n[[artist:charles-neudorf|Charles \"Crazy-8\" Neudorf]]<br>\n[[artist:catboss|Mai Yishan (Cat Boss)]]<br>\n[[artist:brad-griffin|Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin]]<br>\n[[artist:mark-ciocca|Mark \"Dagoth Xil\" Ciocca]]\n\n<b>-MASTERING-</b><br>\n[[artist:brad-griffin|Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin]]<br>\n[[artist:veritas-unae]]\n\n<b>-COMMENTARY BOOKLET-</b><br>\n[[artist:brad-griffin|Brad \"Avinoch\" Griffin]]\n\n<b>-WEBSITE CODING-</b><br>\n[[artist:veritas-unae]]\n\n<b>-WEBSITE HOSTING-</b><br>\nAndrewNeo and skaia.net\n\n<b>-INSPIRATION-</b><br>\n[[artist:andrew-hussie]] & [[artist:what-pumpkin-games|What Pumpkin Studios]]<br>\nThe Homestuck Music Team",

Anyways this is a song I made JUST FOR THE ALBUM!!! Wowee. There's a lot going on here. There's the intro which is like Lord English taking a proverbial shit on everything by existing or something like that, then it sort of BLEHs and goes into the main part of the song. Right off the bat you've got [[Sburban Jungle]]'s marimba part played backwards on a piano, and then there's some stuff from [[track:the-paradox-paradigm|a fan song]] that I don't remember the title of. THEN there's stuff from [[track:empirical|Condy's song]] off [[album:tomb-of-the-ancestors|the unofficial ancestor album]], and some stuff from some other things. There's basically a lot of things!! It's a very thing filled song.\n\n<i>Skylar:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\npaige told me the song was about doc scratch, the condesce and lord english, and since the track was titled chronology i tried to show some sort of a progression within the track art while expressing some of the background of each character."

I say written in quotation marks because at the time all I had was a cool bassline and a title, I was in a complete musical slump on what to do with the piece, and so I turned to my friend Shadolith for help. Shadolith not only helped to come up with better ideas for the song, but actually finished most if it on her own. I'm really glad she did though, otherwise the song would have never been finished, and it wouldn't be playing in your ears right now!\n\n<i>8bitkitten:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nHere's my track art for \"Jackpot\"! It's a Roxy strife theme, and since we have yet to witness such an event in Homestuck, let's make believe. ;3"

When it finally came time to start, I wanted to go for the *spacey,* electronic, •hardcore* sounding style that I attempted a little bit with [[Electrocumulus]].

I'd been messing about on guitar and found that most of the first theme from [[Skies of Skaia]] was playable with harmonics in standard tuning, and only the top note wasn't possible. By returning to EADF#BE and putting a capo on at the 5th fret it was possible then to play the whole thing.\n\nThe piece was originally just going to be loose reworking of Skies of Skaia using lots of acoustic guitars but then the second theme felt like it needed something more. I ended up adding drums and electric instruments for the second section to lift the piece and finished off with a little guitar improv into the quiet harmonics to finish.\n\nI liked the alliteration in the title and it was pretty much how I thought of the piece. There's not really a reason for the hint to Sherlock Holmes.\n\n<i>dodostad:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI can admit that I had no idea where this was going when I painted it. I don't think I've ever drawn clouds before either haha."

A few months later I listened to the old project files again and liked this part enough to make it its own piece. I think inspiration for this style came from Average White Band's [*Pick Up the Pieces*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnH_zwVmiuE) but I can't remember for sure."

The scene for the piece ends when she goes all vampirey on Feferi.\n\nRejected alternate title: 'All the colours of the rainbow (are delicious)'\n\n<i>Maddie Haines:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI saw the name Rainbow Rebirth and immediately wanted to do something cool with Kanaya and her fairly new rainbow drinker status, since I was pretty dang sure that was what the title was referencing. Since it was her care for the matriorb that led up to her transformation, I thought it made the most sense to include it, as well as rainbow colors, obviously, into this picture."

[[artist:clark-powell|Plazmataz]] has always, always impressed me, but Flare just evoked something simply raw in the depths of my mind; I knew then that I had to use that feeling as a kind of empathy towards the Beta kids. Though it was used in a specific moment in canon, I chose to write lyrics from the point of view I could most appreciate -- the pain associated with love when life hands you something you don't know how to survive.\n\n<i>fueledbyanimation:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI have been listening to Horizon's renditions of Homestuck music with her lyrics for a while now, and Flare has always been my favorite one she did.

Looking back, I have no idea why I chose to remix this song in particular; it must have just been stuck in my head that day. As one could gather from the title, this remix is supposed to be an upbeat, elecronic remix. As I was composing, it seemed to turn into a dance track of sorts. The genre still fit my idea, so I kept going. I think it was a rather successful first Homestuck remix.\n\n<i>plaidcushion:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nThe songs this was remixed from are associated with Skaia and the battlefield, but I thought that Electrocumulus was way too high energy and fun for something like that. I decided to go for the next best thing- John speeding through Skaia and plowing through clouds in his Dad's car! As it turns out, exploded clouds are also rpetty fun to cut out with a scalpel."

Around this time I was still really just a budding musician, and I wanted to make something heavy out of the [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] theme by [[artist:malcolm-brown]]. The idea was imagining what kind of soundtrack would be backing the kids as they face Lord English in a climactic battle. I was proud of it at the time but in retrospect it never really aged that well. Despite this it remained one of my most popular works.\n\nAround the time I finished [[Rust Maid]] and [[Orange Hat]], I was approached for the inclusion of the remix in LOFAM2. While I was happy to have the opportunity to give people the download so many of them clamored for, I really, really had to fix so many of it's glaring issuse, and as such I remastered it for the album.\n\n<i>devonianecho:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\n[[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] has always been one of the most memorable pieces of music in Homestuck, forever representing a (if not the) quintessential \"strife\" theme. With this in mind, I think I had almost too much freedom in choosing the conflict I wanted to depict in this piece. Initially, I was going to make it John vs. Dad [[flash:90|from Act 1]]... but that ended up being a little too underwhelming in comparison to the song it was for. So, in the end, I settled upon focusing the piece on a determined-looking John about to face down the underling horde at the beginning of [[flash:4109|Cascade]]. I'm pretty happy with the end result."

You know, waaaay back in the beginning of the comic when the Beta kids were still on planet Earth and were being harassed by trolls. So nearly a year later, I figured that a strife page would make for an excellent cover. Admittedly action poses have always been a weakness of mine, so I probably drew each kid at least twice for this cover until I was satisfied. Still though, I'm happy with how the art came out.

Similarly to a good portion of my work [[Black]]/[[track:liquid-negrocity|Liquid Negrocity's]] leitmotif plays a prominent feature in the composition, providing the base melody for the entire track. The idea for Irradiated spurred from [[flash:2927|Jade: Enter]], as a high-velocity and energetic track with none other than Jack Noir at the center; my goal was to take Black and give it a different feel. After a short hiatus, my track Irradiated featured in [[flash:fan-animation-homestuck|my first tribute animation]] [on youtube](https://youtu.be/hnG10rk9lqg) for Homestuck.\n\n<i>Spectrumfizz:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nIrradiated is among the first homestuck fanmusic tracks I ever heard, so I was very pleased to be able to create art to accompany it on LOFAM2.

The more I worked on it, the more I noticed the composition was bearing a strong resemblance to Rob Dougan's [[track:clubbed-to-death-kurayamino-variation|\"Clubbed to Death\"]], so I kind of ran with that influence, and this is the result.\n\nWhen [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the Homestuck fanmusic competition]] was announced, I made some updates to the song and tried submitting it for that (special thanks to [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] for offering some last minute advice).\n\nThis song holds a lot of personal importance to me. Before this piece I had never ever brought a composition to a completed state, let alone posted it for the world to see. Obviously I still have much room for improvement, but the fact that my debut work has received such positive feedback has been a huge encouragement.\n\nThank you all for listening!"

What I want is for people who heard the first one to think, \"wow, this guy really got less bad in a year.\" It references all the songs it originally did, whether in the same basic way ([[Courser]], [[track:ruins|Ruins]]) or differently ([[Dawn of Man]], [[the rose rap]]).\n\nThat one terrible LEGENDARY ENDLESS DVS SAX song I made almost went on the album instead of this and I felt like paying tribute to it, so that's where the little sax riff came from.\n\n<i>Lunise:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI had the feeling that I had to meet some pretty high expectations when I was called upon to draw this one, so I was pretty nervous about doing it. I spent a long time mulling over how I was going to go about drawing this track art after I completed the art for [[track:stalemate-play-the-rain]]. We don't know nearly as much about the denizens as we do about the kids or the trolls or even the carapacians, but I took what we do know about the beta kids' denizens and ran with it.\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i> (booklet editor, booklet commentary)\n\nnote: Lunise wrote seven paragraphs about the creative process behind this wonderful art piece. I can only fit the first one on the page.\n\n<i>Unofficial MSPA Fans:</i> ([Tumblr](https://hsfanmusic.skaia.net/post/39025832110/tiny-mayo-this-is-the-last-piece-of-track-art))\n\nHere is the full commentary to the rise of the denizens track art. c:\n\n<i>Lunise:</i> ([Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/tiny-mayo/35620971215/this-is-the-last-piece-of-track-art-for-lofam2))\n\nThis is the last piece of track art for LOFAM2 that I believe I need to contribute, for The Lovable Tramp’s Rise of the Denizens!\n\n*(Continued from booklet commentary)*\n\nThere were actually a few goofs with the original composition of this drawing - Cetus' tail was originally pointing to the left but I then decided that having it face the right would give the overall drawing more flow. Also in Hephaestus' section of the art I had forgotten that Davesprite was injured when he went to him to get the Deringer repaired so for the longest time he had both wings at their full length. Not much to say about Typheus' section; I had a good idea of what I was going to do with it fairly early on.\n\nEchidna's section is primarily inspired by the track art for Volume 8's [[Bargaining with the Beast]], as far as her design goes. I was originally going to include Jack to the right of Jade in that section, but I didn't find anywhere to put him and I found that the composition looked just fine without him anyway! Although in [this memo](https://www.homestuck.com/story/3976) Jade says that Jack was with him when she was talking with Echidna and I really wanted to draw him, I just couldn't make him fit. Perhaps I'll try and remedy that if I ever make a high-resolution version of this!\n\nI knew immediately that I wanted Echidna to be the main focus out of all the denizens because she's really important in the story since she makes Jade promise to take all the planets, the consorts, the denizens, and everything to the alpha session even if it meant Jade had to die. Then there's Typheus, who's facing doomed John, and Hephaestus looking down on Davesprite and offering him <b>The Choice</b>, and Cetus swimming around in the seas of LOLAR, which is now devoid of fish.\n\nI tried to make the sections flow together the best I could - the top areas where Cetus and Typheus' sections blend into Hephaestus' section kind of fade without any borders, but I decided to make little borders based on each kid's aspect to separate each section from Echidna's section. The breath and light symbols are done in an abstract manner while the time and space symbols are just the straight-up time and space symbols; the space one just overlaps the time one.\n\nI think I've rambled enough about this piece of track art, so I'm going to let the rest speak for itself! I hope I've done a good enough job living up to the LOFAM2 team's expectations, and if I've exceeded them, that's great too!\n\nThis has been another rambling commentary from Lune.\n\n(THIS TRACK ALSO CAUSED ME A LOT OF PAIN AND SUFFERING BUT IT WAS MORE LIKE \"DEAR GOODNESS WHERE DO ALL THESE LAYERS KEEP COMING FROM\" THAN [[track:stalemate-play-the-rain#artist-commentary|\"OH GOD HOW AM I GOING TO COLOR ALL THIS BLACK.\"]]\n\nAs another side note, the layered .lip file for this had a total of 60 layers not counting the texture layer!\n\n**BONUS:** When I was starting work on this, instead of copying the texture layer, I accidentally copied Jack over from the layered version of the [[track:stalemate-play-the-rain]] track art. I couldn't bear to delete him from the file, so he got to stay on the condition that his layer stayed invisible. Sometimes I'd make it visible when I was bored! Poor guy just keeps getting chased by things - first an angry PM and now an angry sea denizen!)\n\n<small>#lune draws things once every blue moon #lune is still terrible at commentary but that's okay?</small>"

[[Dawn of Man]] is a favorite of mine from that album, and it also happens to be a partial remix of Sburban Jungle. In the Homestuck tradition, the natural thing to do then was mix them together, along with a cameo from [[Exodus]], featured in [[album:sburb-ost|SBURB]]. The instruments are based primarily on Dawn of Man, bringing in some of Sburban Jungle's mallet percussion and a few of my own additions. The result is Sburban Genesis, a song ultimately inspired by the mysterious origins of the game and its multi-universal legacy.\n\n<i>plaidcushion:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nThis really sounded like a night time kind of song to me, which I think went nicely with the baby frog Jade finds on her island as a kid. He's a pretty cute little guy, but his role carries a lot of weight, so I think he fits the song pretty well."

              "Commentary": "<i>Nitrosparxx:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nQuite possibly the saddest piece of music I've ever written. This was what I was originally going to use for the fan album, but I decided to drop it half way through making it on the grounds that it didn't sound like a Homestuck song. Jack Noir (and by extension, Bec Noir) always struck me as a tragic character. The way I see it, he's always violent because of the abuse he receives from the black queen. He's physically shut down all other emotions save for hatred because as far as he's concerned, there is no such thing. However things change for him when Bec becomes prototyped. He suddenly has a heart and has new feelings. Bec's influence taught him what it's like to feel for someone else, although Jack desperately tried so hard to ignore these feelings. When Jade died, Jack finally knew what it felt to lose someone so close to your heart. A tragic character indeed...\n\n<i>Corrina:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nGiven the fact that the song references [[track:the-beginning-of-something-really-excellent|Jade's theme]], I thought that I'd go with something that has to do with the characters' relationship. In the picture, I had originally intended Jade to be a sort-of ghost image, as if she wasn't really there. I wanted to show that Jack was alone, but I later changed that aspect, despite how much I loved the idea. Making her more faded created imbalance in the work, and the details were also washed out."

However, every time I sat down to work on the song, I found myself experimenting with several of John's themes instead. Eventually I relented and combined those experiments into a song for John.\n\nEven though neither of my entries was selected for the contest album, I'm still immensely grateful for the experience. The process of preparing my songs for the competition taught me a lot about music production and showed me some of the areas I might improve on in future (specifically: I need to stop quoting existing songs so much and focus on creating original melodies).\n\nSo again, thank you [[artist:andrew-hussie|Andrew]] and everyone on the music team; both for that opportunity and for all your creative work which inspired me in the first place. Thanks [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] for offering some last minute advice (though I didn't get a chance to implement half of those suggestions...). And, of course, thank you [[artist:lizawithazed|Liza]] and [[artist:lambda-elise-merryberry|Xzaz]] for organizing this second Homestuck Fan Music Album; your dedication and enthusiasm is truly an inspiration.\n\n<i>Racheme:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nThis shows little John asking his older self if they saved Dad from the game. I wanted to reflect some inner workings in John's mind, he still thinks about his only family rather than simply drawing him as powerful and never giving up like in most pictures."

As the title suggests, I wanted to write something that represented the first act of Homestuck, to capture the feeling of the story as we are introduced to its darker elements - the [[flash:82|Wind Skims the Void]] flash is a good example to use. That page is almost like a title screen for the webcomic as a whole, not giving away a thing, but nudging ever so slightly towards things to come; likewise, the repeating piano ostinato in here pays tribute to [[track:presentiment|the Chrono Trigger title music]]. Little did we know at the time, though, how destructive the conductor's baton can be.\n\nHere's hoping for a happy ending.\n\n<i>Fortnight:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nFirst of all- I love this track, it sounds to me like the start of something new, with hope and high expectations thrown in. I drew this track art based off that mood and also [[flash:82|the unnamed flash from Act 1]], [page 1982](https://homestuck.com/story/82)."

Originally entered in [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the contest to select tracks for Colours and Mayhem]], it was a song geared towards John and his powers as an Heir of Breath. I chose a very laid back feel to this piece, progressing from a soft choir at the beginning, picking up an arpeggiated synth and kick on the way to a more intense section of the song. I wanted the song to flow just like the wind: starting softly, the breeze picks up gradually, when suddenly a gust of wind comes, only to leave just as fast as it came."

I set out to create something epic, fast-paced, and exciting, but once I'd finished the first part, I found it was missing something. So I approached MSPA forumite and fellow Homestuck fan musician [[artist:d-crystal]] to see if he could add some guitar and drum tracks. He was happy to oblige, and the end result turned out much better than the work I could do by myself. I learned two lessons that day: one, that two heads are better than one and collaboration is incredibly fun, and two, that electric guitars make everything better."

It obviously didn't make the cut, and Jane ended up receiving a much more badass theme in the form of [[Cyan Beast]]. At the time when I wrote the song (around January 29, 2012), we really didn't know much about Jane beyond the fact that she was a nice girl who enjoyed baking. I tried to give her a theme that was quaint and melodic, not too energetic like my other submissions; compared to most of the other characters, Jane is very down-to-earth, which I admired. Structurally, it loosely parallels [[Fuchsia Witch]], which was originally titled \"Jake's Theme.\"\n\n<i>positivelymorbid:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nWhen I first listened to it, I thought it was a really calm, tranquil song, so I thought maybe Jane relaxing. The more I listened to it, the more adventurous it sounded. Then it hit me, why not Jane having a picnic in LOCAH, picnics are relaxing and adventurous. Overall, I enjoyed the song, and I really enjoyed drawing this art for it."

While pretty, it hardly showcased my abilities as a musician or a producer. So in about the span of the week, I arranged, composed, and produced a traditional string quartet, heavily inspired by cellist and multitrack recording artist, Zoë Keating. All the recording was done with only my viola and my signature production style.\n\nI remember it being a week of musical hell for me, but I'm quite proud of the end results. Perhaps one day, I'll be able to rerecord it with a proper quartet. One can dream at least.\n\n<i>Reid Slater:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI wanted to represent the beta kids reaching their godtier status while mixing in the royalty theme that Samm's song gave me. Samm said to me himself that he thought of the crowning scene in Narnia and the four thrones, and I thought it was suitable to represent them with crowns, holding the Skaia they influenced and looking content and almost relieved in each other's company. I wanted to create something happy and a little bitter-sweet, which was the feeling I got from Samm's track. And I wanted to show that sort of unity and friendship the kids have, even after all they've been through."

I'd never made anything as complex as Indigo Archer before and on top of that I had massive anxieties about getting into the competition. I was stressed out! So Blood Knight nearly never happened.\n\nAbout a week before [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the music contest]] ended, I was talking to my best friend and he said he thought I could make a kickass song for Karkat. I didn't really believe him at first. Karkat is one of my favourite characters and I didn't feel confident about capturing him at all. But my friend persisted and threw a few ideas at me. Eventually I found myself in Cubase making music again with my best friend to thank for it.\n\nImmediately, I knew it needed electric guitars. That was problematic for me as I'd never, ever gotten synthesised guitars to sound halfway decent before. Heck, I'm still not entirely sure how I managed it, but I'm super happy with how it turned out. The feel of it matches what I was going for; not quite metal, not quite a ballad, kind of melancholy but also kind of in your face. Sort of. You might be able to tell that I had an easier time making it than describing it, heh. Pretty darn proud of this piece."

I actually composed this while the composition was playing. I would listen to the notes I had composed, and I would just place new notes where I think they would work while listening. Somehow, everything just seemed to fit together - the violins, the synths, the percussion - everything just worked. The structure of this composition just flowed. I'm pretty sure this is one of my best pieces so far."

I had just installed a new copy of FL Studio after losing my old copy in a hard drive crash two years earlier. I imemediately threw together about five Homestuck songs in a desperate attempt to get on the music team. Shortly thereafter, I discovered about a thousand other fan musicians like myself (and also [[album:lofam|LOFAM I]]), and quietly accepted that I would never, ever be on an official Homestuck album.\n\nA year and a half later, Red Miles definitely sounds like a first attempt. My only objective was to try to make the most over-the-top, attention-grabbing chiptune-metal song I could muster, so I threw in every trope I knew: the pipe organ, the wall of 8-bit synths, the Inferno electric guitar patch, and the [[Sburban Jungle]] motif (which I would use many, many more times). It may have been a bit much, but it was a necessary first step."

After re-arranging it into a solo piano piece, I sat on it for a while. Eventually I began to work on another remix, but forgot about it. Then the song was nominated for Land of Fans and Music 2, and I rushed to polish up the song now that I had better tools and more skill. But I'd lost the original file, and the only remaining part of the scrapped remix was the right-hand piano notes (luckily, those were the most important part of the song)! The new remix is exotic and a bit hypnotic, symbolizing John and Vriska's journey through the surreal and fantastic memory-realms of the afterlife.\n\n<i>Cap:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nOriginally, I planned to do a sentimental image of Vriska standing in the snow, but it turned out pretty lame. Then I figured hey, since I'm making something for a fantastic song for an amazing troll, why not make the piece almost as gr8t as her? So the snow idea melted and turned into this bizarre, dreambubble-ish creation!\n\nNow imagine my surprise when I heard that Ascenzo later remixed the song and made it like 16,777,216 times cooler."

I wanted the piece to have that [[artist:michael-guy-bowman|'Bowman']] quality to it, while still refraining from outright copying his ideas off in any particular way - the heavy use of guitars and fleeting synths was my way of capturing the emotion that Bowman injects into his music, to bring across his characterisation.

That, however, didn't pan out, and it ended up turning into a fast-paced,  high-energy strife theme more in the vein of [\"The Curse of Sorrow\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uJhva1jvWw) from Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia (the only Castlevania game I've actually come close to beating), especially the organ, electric guitar, and snappy drum kit. The main melody has some resemblance to the Black King's theme from [[track:rex-duodecim-angelus|\"Rex Duodecim Angelus\"]] by [[artist:malcolm-brown]], but not enough to qualify as a remix or arrangement.\n\n<i>Ducky Senpai:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nI initially had no idea what I was going to do for this song. I skimmed through the tracks and noticed this one by Willow Ascenzo (who did some of my favorites on [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a]] like [[Teal Hunter]] and [[Violet Mariner]]), and I was instantly sold probably because of my love for pipe organs. Anyway, for a lack of better inspiration, I used the description left on soundcloud - \"Final battle with Lord English.\" Tie that to Aranea's mentioning that Jake was destined to beat Lord English, and I had my inspiration. The lineart took much longer than it should have since my tablet had been freaking out and I haven't gotten the new one yet, but the coloring went quite smoothly."

It's supposed to be a [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] for the new generaiton, a strife theme for Jake English - although the melody ended up sounding more like [[track:dissension-original|Dissension]] than Showtime. The progression is supposed to be Showtime-esque as well, starting from [[track:showtime-piano-refrain|the piano refrain]], going into a chiptune-esque portion, and finally building to a BOSS FIGHT version, using punchy drums (the punchiest!) to simulate gunshots.\n\nSo close your eyes and imagine Jake doing that thing where he flies through the air shooting both guns at once. Yes. So sweet. Wouldn't it be great if there were an animated flash to go with it? That would be SUPER SWEET.\n\n(Bonus fun fact: the last 30 seconds of the song was actually the first part to be conceptualized!)\n\n<i>Catboss:</i> (composer, [SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/catbossstudio/guns-blazing))\n\n&gt; Jake: Fly through the air shooting two guns at once.\n\n<hr>\n\nThe first of my three entries to the Homestuck Music Contest, the other two being [[Vodka Mutiny]] and [[track:daywalker-rise-contest|Daywalker ~Rise~]].\n\nThis didn't get in, even though I felt that it was my strongest contender. I hoped that it could serve as the \"Showtime\" for the Alpha kids, and modelled it specifically after [[track:showtime-original-mix|\"Showtime\"]] and [[track:dissension-original|\"Dissension,\"]] with a recognizable motif repeated in different styles.\n\nFun fact: I came up with the last 1 minute of the song or so first; I got the idea to use punchy snares to simulate Jake shooting everywhere. I quite like the result!"

Whilst I think that structurally the track is a little too similar to [[track:showtime-original-mix|the original]] and if I were to make another remix I would do things quite differently, this piece was the one which began to outline my chiptune style which I've since developed with my other Homestuck tracks. My main influences with chiptune are from the SID and Yamaha chips found in the C64 and Sega Mega Drive respectively, and as such many synth and percussive elements from each can be heard in my work.\n\n<i>fueledbyanimation:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nTo fit a remix of one of my favorite Homestuck themes, I wanted to make the Strife scene between Dad and John in my own style, while still holding somewhat true to the original. A remix of the art as well as the song.\n\n<i>Svix:</i> ([FurAffinity](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/2768815/))\n\n\"Your DAD wields a dreaded ARTIFACT OF CONFECTION. He stands between you and the mail.\n\nThere is only one way to settle this.\n\nSTRIFE!\"\n\nRemix of the battle theme from Homestuck, an amazingly quirky and hilarious story based on old text input adventure games.

Sorry?\nShould I apologize when you ignore me?\nI didn’t ask to be right or to be lonely\nOr to be hatched into an ugly story\n\nI'm a prince and I had a pair of princesses in two sharp squares\nBut then I guess I bored them both to death\nAnd now I think my calling is to break apart and fall to pieces\nBetter yet, invent a brand new method of ascension\n\nI’m impressed, you’ve managed to survive\nBut rest assured we’d all be better off dead than alive\n'Cause when they get a hold of us, we’ll all be batter-fried\nAnd I’m surprised that nobody’s considered switching sides\n\nSo here I am, respectfully and royally destroying\nAny chance of getting back on your good gills\nAnd I don’t mean to be hurtful, but if yellow's the new purple\nWell, then bleeding’s the new breathing, don’t you think I will\n\nI used to wish the death of every living thing\nI might be your killer but you’ll never be my queen\nSo put away your laughter, pack up your hopes and dreams\nI’m done with black back-handing and red pandering, it seems\n\nThat I am just pathetic, I won’t be overlooked\nI’m past the point of fishing to get back upon your hook\nI’ve made a manifesto, I’ve been bested by a crook, but never more\nI’m planning on reclaiming what he took\n\nSo what did you want me to say? Sorry?\nShould I apologize when you ignore me?\nI didn’t ask to be right or to be lonely\nOr to be hatched into an ugly story\nTo be hatched into an ugly story\nOh my, this pantomime is getting gory\n\nI'm a prince and I live in a ship\nI'm a prince and I live in a ship",

I think there's a lot to his character people normally forget and I just wanted to expand on his motivations a bit.\n\n<i>prismatic-void:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nThe first time I heard the song I thought it described Eridan perfectly. It's about being left behind and distrusted by the only people he ever put faith in. He's angry and selfish and decides to forget about them in favor of his own goals. I wanted to show him essentially walking away from the ghosts of his past and doing his best to ignore how much they've hurt him."

The first [[album:lofam|Land of Fans and Music]] had two of my early songs on it, and I felt it was appropriate that I do my best and show how far I'd come in a year for the second album. \"Ave Dei Novi\" takes its cue, partially, from the bombastic and incredible Gundam Unicorn soundtrack by Sawano Hiroyuki, especially in the orchestra and percussion grooves, which I worked very hard on. I think I'm most proud of the bongo groove breakdown in the middle and the [[track:atomyk-ebonpyre|\"Atomyk Ebonpyre\"]] section near the end. Those two parts ended up especially fantastic.\n\n<i>xkoraxayomex:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nOverall I feel that the artwork suits the piece in terms of relativity and presentation. I think it looks refined and somewhat detailed, but there is room for improvement. When I read the title for the piece, Ascension, I automatically thought back to Jade's god tier, as it is simply gorgeous and I just love it. It was a milestone for her becoming an even more essential character in Homestuck.\n\n<i>Lambda Elise Merryberry:</i> (album organizer, booklet commentary)\n\nthis song was originally titled \"ascension\", but there was to be another song on lofam2 with a similar title (\"god tier ascension\") (except now there isn't) so [[artist:willow-ascenzo|wmm]] changed it to \"ave dei novi\" which translates to \"hail the new gods\""

[[Umbral Ultimatum]] remains one of my favorite HS songs, and I wanted to do something in 3/4 time using the opening melody. The song's development is kind of a blur to me now, I was busy with work and was experiencing some anxiety problems, and threw the song together over a two or three-day period, but it obviously took a very dark turn somewhere along the way. Whatever happened, I'm still pretty pleased with how it turned out."

It just sounds nicer now, and that guitar solo part at the end helps add a real finish to the piece while referencing both titular tracks in a different, significant way.\n\nOh and the title makes me think of [The Dance of Eternity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ik9qECIWgc) by Dream Theater which is a really cool song."

It wasn't meant for Homestuck, it wasn't meant for Tumblr or anyone to see it. But a fantastic friend of mine told me about [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|the Homestuck Music competition]], so I figured why not. I sent this in after tweaking it a bit, and just for fun, threw it up on Tumblr. I then left for vacation, but still had internet access. I came back to see my song exploded on Tumblr, and was promptly getting upwards of 1,000-3,000 views a week. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. The song itself was kind of... my own personal blend? I love songs that combine organic and inorganic elements, and with Homestuck being the big thing on the block lately, I decided to try it out. As evidence by this album, it didn't make it, but it certainly was a big hit. However, what's funnier is that the version I put on Tumblr was the unmastered version, so when I put the mastered version up, it didn't get nearly as many hits as the unmastered version.\n\nA lot of people have asked me whether or not I'm going to make a second Homestuck track. And as much as I love the motivation from fans to do so, I don't think I could handle trying to one-up a piece like this and failing. So, here's to you, Homestuck.\n\n<i>dodostad:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nFor me the song was about alpha kids, no question about it. It took me a long time to come up with a composition that I liked and that seemed to fit the song. LOOK OUT FOR THE MILES JANE"

              "Commentary": "<i>Rachel Rose Mitchell:</i> (composer, booklet commentary)\n\nPlanetarium was the first piece of Homestuck fan music I ever made. I'd only just caught up with the archives when I was set a composition assignment for university. Having never used Logic to compose before, I had fun playing with a bunch of the different inbuilt instruments. When I found the koto, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I tried to make it sound somewhat ethereal and otherworldly to represent the Incipisphere in all its beautiful weirdness. To try to do that, I threw a whole lot of reverb and delay at pretty much every track. I really did not know what I was doing, but it was fun.\n\nThe vocal lines were an afterthought. Actually, no, they were less than an afterthought. They weren't actually something I thought I should include at all, but the assignment had a requirement of at least four recorded audio tracks. I threw those lines together at home on Cubase (I don't actually have a Mac, let alone Logic!) the morning the piece was drew it, slapped them onto the piece with Logic that day and got the assignment in just in time. But in the end, I think they enhanced the feel of the piece, so I'm kind of glad I had to chuck them in there!\n\n<i>Spectrumfizz:</i> (track artist, booklet commentary)\n\nThis is probably my favoured piece from my two more serious ones. I wanted to make a layout reminiscent of an actual planetarium, and I think I achieved that well (the \"strings\" hanging up the planets are simultaneously that and the kids' houses built up towards Skaia, which indicates that I kind of overthought this). I'm actually pretty fond of how the tiny Beat Mesa and Prospit's moon turned out.\n\nOh yeah, the song itself is also SUPER pretty (I'm surprised I managed to snag such a lovely song to make art for), but you'll know that already considering you're probably listening to it right now."

They both have elements that originated from Vertigo.\n\nThis song was also a part of my scrapped self-titled album, but oh well. That didn't happen.\n\nEnjoy!",

I had never music hacked (note-wise) before this hack, so it took me a while to get used to the system and get good at it, which is why the last boss song sounds the best and the early songs sound kind of crappy.\nJust to help you understand why it took me a while to make GOOD music, here's a picture of the music editor:\n\n<img src=\"media/misc/music-ebhh.png\" width=\"356\" length=\"267\">\n\nIf you have no idea what the hell is going on, you're pretty much on the same boat I was. Music is pretty much coded through a bunch of different numbers telling the game how long notes are, what pitch they are, etc. Pretty much you need to be able to look at numbers and hear music like it's the Matrix or something. It was ridiculous.\nEven as I got better, songs took a hell of a long time to make. I know that the last boss song took me an entire Sunday to do, just because I had to code every single slide, every single fade-in, every single instrument change, every single NOTE... seriously. When you play my hack, just appreciate every single note and pixel I had to make. It took forever, okay!?",

Lake:</i> ([Bandcamp download blurb](https://spellmynamewithabang.bandcamp.com/album/stuckhome-syndrome-part-one-v1-years-in-the-past), excerpt)\n\nStuckhome Syndrome Part One, Volume One is a collection of every song I ever did for Homestuck that never got used, and it's a collection of every song I ever did for Homestuck - be they finished or even just light throwaway sketches - that never got used.\n\nThis will release more like a video game, with free DLC updates throughout the next few months. I'll update the album with a changelog and announce each swath of updates. Make sure you get a Bandcamp fan account when you buy if you don't have one already; that will let you download the album multiple times so you can keep updating to the current version. Aside from more polish, better mixing, and better versions of bonus tracks, you can expect expanded liner notes, track art, and more over the next few months - all included with the one time price.\n\nIf you don't wanna deal with all of this weird video game release methodology garbage, that's fine too! I'll be releasing this as a set of multiple split albums of more manageable size as I finish up each individual release, with the first in the near future, for if you just have a bunch of albums instead of one huge mutant thing! You'll be able to buy a pass for all of the albums for the same price as this album, so you won't be missing out. Make sure you're following me on twitter at https://twitter.com/spellbang for updates on that!\n\nThank you so much for supporting me!\n\n<i>Robert J! Lake:</i> ([Tumblr pre-order announcement](https://www.tumblr.com/spellmynamewithabang/140367744668/ok-actual-stuckhome-syndrome-big-post-and-whatever), excerpt)\n\nHere’s the breakdown:\n\n<b>APRIL THIRTEEN: Stuckhome Syndrome Part 1 V1: <i>Years in the Past</i></b>\n\nThe first and biggest (by volume, not effort) of the four albums is a collection of every unreleased Homestuck track I’ve ever made (with one important exception) polished up as much as I possibly can. It’s going to be released as a 43 track album with hundreds of bonus tracks included once you buy it, partially because putting 413+ songs on a single bandcamp page is a ridiculous, tiring amount of scrolling and I don’t want to put you through that.\n\nWill have liner notes and all that for every song if I can hack it, plus track art (possibly yours! scroll down for more info)\n\n<b>JUNE TWELVE: Stuckhome Syndrome Part 1 V2: <i>Gaiden (Reloaded)</i></b>\n\nTitle in progress, I think, because that’s dumb, but this is all the songs I did for [[group:homestuck-gaiden|Homestuck Gaiden]], plus from-the-ground-up remakes of all of them. I’m toying with getting other artists from the Gaiden page on there as well. So! Hopefully this will be a good compromise, given that the Gaiden page as it stands is basically a dead horse, which is something I’m pretty sure I can’t talk about further! So I won’t, uh, touch on that. (I’m sure someone has the files if you hunt around, but it won’t be me.)\n\n<b>AUGUST EIGHT: Stuckhome Syndrome Part 1 V3: <i>Coolkid’s on the Block</i></b>\n\nMy solo Dave album, originally planned for a What Pumpkin release years ago, finally hits your ears. Only about four years late. Plus all bonuses planned.\n\n<b>OCTOBER TWENTY-FIFTH: Stuckhome Syndrome Part 2: From Before the Beginning to After the End, PLUS A BIG HUGE SURPRISE</b>\n\nAll those songs I did for Homestuck you heard already? Picture them completely reimagined. Each one gets a total rethink from the ground up, keeping the soul of the original in a fancy new 2016 body.\n\nThat same day, something insane is getting launched, and I think it will blow your collective brains, but nicely. I’ll tease it more closer to the date.\n\n<i>[Wiki note: As of this writing, no other Stuckhome albums have been released.]</i>",

The new kids were great, and of them Jane was far and away my favorite (which makes sense, given that Jade was my favorite before this; you’ll notice a lot of songs are written with her in mind). My goal here was to make something that mirrored [[track:showtime-original-mix|Showtime]] without imitating or quoting it, and updating it for the new bunch of kids. The idea was that since the original bunch of strife themes were decidedly 8-bit, I’d go 16-bit; so we have Sega PSG and OPM sound chip emulation as the entire instrumentation, except for the spoons. The spoons (courtesy the wonderful Luke Benjamins) are there because she’s a baker, and Betty Crocker, and you get it."

Brings back memories.\nWhich reminds me: DID YOU KNOW that on 4/13 I’m releasing an album of music I did for Homestuck that has over four <b>hundred</b> songs on it? Yeah, it’s true. And it costs only $11.43! And <b>right now</b> you can get it for only <i>$9.87.</i> <b>That’s crazy. Here’s the link: https://spellmynamewithabang.bandcamp.com/album/stuckhome-syndrome-part-one-v1-years-in-the-past</b>\nHere’s a song from that album.

Given the jump elsewhere from 8 to 16 bit, I figured a jump from 90s/early 00s sim game pastiche to a more modern vibe seemed analogous, so you have this ambient texturey vibe that fits with stuff like <i>Spore</i> (which was a big inspiration) and other stuff of the like.\nDisasterpeace and Ryan Roth were definitely big influences on this as well!"

But if he was honest, truly, deeply honest with himself, that's all he really needed. What could he possibly want more?\nI guess he'd been waiting a pretty long time for a game he'd been excited for. A game he wanted to play with all of his friends. And on his thirteenth birthday, the day he got the name, \"John\", he would.\nNow John had a penchant for being a bit of a prankster, so when he started the game he fooled around quite a lot. Made a huge mess everywhere, knocked things all over... it really wasn't productive in the least. But to be fair, the game didn't seem to have a point at first, even as it layered complicated system over complicated system, seemingly just for convolution's sake.\nBut John worked through the menus and complexity as best as he could, and he seemed to get a decent handle on it eventually - solving the first puzzle and allowing himself a small feeling of victory, even if it was over something comparatively simplistic.\nBut that moment didn't last because a meteor, seemingly out of nowhere, came hurtling down from all the way in space! It would have crushed him and his house had he not at the crucial moment taken a bite of a magic apple which spared him and his place and prepared him for his quest.\nYou see, John wasn't just playing a game. He was, unbeknownst to him, turning the key that opened his future's door, changing the entire course of his life - and it wasn't actually even the first time this had happened! This had been repeated an infinite number of times before now... though, how could he have possibly known that?\nBut this time was different. This time, everything would work out. He would finally manage to overcome everything in his path.\nSee, John would eventually find himself in a multitude of situations that looked bleak, a world of dangers. But, he would hear a voice calling out to him. And that voice would sing,\nLoudly,\nBut as calmly as he could, to John.\nSinging:\n\"John, do the windy thing.\"",

Written as an end credits theme for Homestuck as a whole in, like, early 2011? New stuff here is the guitar, which is literally all I changed; the Pixies-ish vibe on it just feels right. Probably one of my most melodically articulate compositions ever, and just a compositional high point for me in general. Sometimes a melody takes ages of work to figure out; I work by ear, and when something sounds bad (i.e. trite, boring, too much like a bad old third-rate video game soundtrack and not enough like a, you know, good melody), it can be a while before I can make it sound good.

So this was originally written for the Jade album that never happened (more on that later) but then I reworked it after it was pretty clear no more Homestuck music was going to happen (at least for a while) for a game called <i>Sheep Keeper</i>, which, amazingly, never ended up coming out. And I can’t find the source file; this is all I have. So you get the sheepy version, and there is almost nothing about sheep in Homestuck except for Aradia, and this song doesn’t feel like it really fits her, and I’m fully admitting this is getting pushed past the 43 mark on the album proper. THAT SAID: I think the melody is cute and solid, and I like the bouncy production. Which is, you know, why it’s not relegated to nothingness here."

I’ll be the first to admit, for instance, that [[track:whistling-jackhammer|Whistling Jackhammer]] is almost more inspired by Hussie’s earlier comic Whistles (hence the title) than Homestuck), but I do know that I reused the title for a game concept I had a few years later I never really went public with. Either way, it’s probably getting moved past track 43 as well; it’s good, and I’m proud of it, (the melodies are very inspired by George & Jonathan, which is a favorite group of mine) but it doesn’t quite feel right where it is. It’s finished, though, as is. A weirdo, for sure."

I consider this kind of a pair with [[track:biophosphoradelecrystalluminescence|Biophosphoradelecrystalluminescence]] in terms of aural space, but this was a Jade album castoff, as are three others here. That was me trying to make a Jade album with [[group:clark-powell|Clark Powell]]; it fell through when the solo albums stopped happening, but we dreamed big. [[track:jane-dargason|Jane Dargason]] is probably the only real collaborative survivor of that in the end; the two of us should work together more. Anyway, this track is light and bouncy and features a lot of vocal samples. It’s exactly the same as it was when I pitched it to [[album:homestuck-vol-9|Volume 9]] (after touching it up more); reusing tracks I did for other Homestuck albums ended up being a trend (so many [[album:the-felt|Felt]] tracks got reused for later albums, like [[track:afraid-of-the-darko|Afraid of the Darko]])."

Cute as heck, with a phenomenal lead melody and chorus. It was very spare when I found it, but aside from doing new production (drums, bass, etc) and writing a new bridge, it’s basically the same as it was in early 2011."

I was relatively new to the fandom, and I thought I'd never in a million years be good enough to do album art, but I really wanted to, so I sucked it up, said to myself, \"The worst thing they can do is tell me No and then forget about me forever,\" so I sent my offer.  And got it?????????\nThen I had to pick an ancestor, and even though I didn't even care about kanaya at the time, when I thought it through, I decided that I'd probably be best at drawing her ancestor.  I figured her classy, demure style would work best with my style of drawing?  So I picked kancestor!\nThen I didn't draw for forever because not knowing what the ancestor looked like made me really nervous.  Then she was revealed finally!!!  And I freaked out and got to drawing.\nI decided I wanted to draw something that would represent a big part of her character.  Since I hadn't heard the song, all I really knew was that if I drew something that was very much a part of her character, it would most likely fit.\nSo I decided to pick a \"scene\" of her very first leaving the caverns to take care of the signless.  Since she has jade blood, I figured she would probably sneak out around daybreak, when no other trolls would be around to see her abandoning her duties.  She had to wrap up tiny grub sufferer so that he wouldn't be hurt by the sunlight, but she would be able to leave without injury.\nShe has her flowy....cloth thing...that's normally around her feet up over her head as a veil.  It's really bright if you've never been outside of a cave your whole life, after all!  So she's lifting it here to take her first look at light on the surface.\nI'm really happy it ended up working so well with the song, and this may be my favorite song from the album because I am a huge sucker for woeful strings.  The song reminds me a LOT of Adagio for Strings which may just be one of the most heartwrenchingly beautiful songs ever written.\nSo hopefully my art of her here is a good representation of her character.  I've been worried about how it would have been received ever since I finished it! hahaha.  But people seem to be liking it, and I couldn't be happier.  I was so honored and ecstatic to be given to opportunity to draw for an album, and it was so much fun.\nThat's all I really had to say I guess. :)  I just felt like sharing my thought process.  xD  Thanks to kali again for the opportunity and the BEAUTIFUL album.  The ancestors have been well represented here I think. c:\n([DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/yoccuri/art/Immaculate-Peacekeeper-269739813))\nforgot to upload this here too! :o for all y'all who use dA still and not just tumblr like me xD\nI did the album art for the Dolorosa's song from the new Tomb of the Ancestors album! :)\nI wrote some commentary about why I drew it and why I drew this specifically on tumblr. You can go read it there if you are interested in a little background on this piece\nThis was a huge challenge artistically! My mom and I puzzled over some fabric trying to figure out how the heck drapery like that veil/cloth thing would even work! The colors and background were a specifically challenging element as well! I really wanted it to be good track art, where you would be able to recognize it at a glance on an mp3 player or computer or something else. And I wanted the picture as a whole to feel like the Dolorosa's character, which I imagine as being solemn and peaceful\nThe song ended up beautiful! I didn't actually get to hear ANY of it until the album was released, so I'm really glad that kali and I were on roughly the same wavelength about her :)\nI hope you all like it! I was an honor and a privilege to get to do this. I'm so grateful ;w;"

Also I couldn't help but mix elements from Flying Battery zone in with [[track:fire-forget|Fire + Forget]] since they seemed to work together so well!"

The more favorable to one the change is, the luckier one is said to be. In contrast, strength can be defined as the measure of one's ability to directly enact change in one's environment. Therefore, though they approach it differently, luck and strength share a common purpose.)",

I really liked the theme, so I made different versions of it over the years, although [[track:bane-old|the last version]] I did was about 13 years ago in 2005. Several times I considered making a new version of it for Homestuck, but I always hesitated. I finally decided to go for it, since this was my last chance."

I ran it by Veri and he found that funny given that Circlejourney made the booklet themself. I’ve confirmed that Circlejourney did in fact help work on the song, so I’d say it’s probably either an overlooked detail, or something Cj themself decided wasn’t worth including.

I tried to quote something by every member of the team. Might've missed a couple people, but I tried my best. Frankly, without Homestuck music, I wouldn't be making music today. If you liked the music at all, I highly recommend tracking down what music team folks are doing nowadays - many of them could really use the support!\n\n(Also it's an arms joke.)"

      "Commentary": "<i>Elaine Wang:</i> (booklet commentary, front)\n\nSo. I'm Elaine Wang, orngjce223, electronic orange juice; and I do stuff. A lot of stuff really, like dragging a friend along on a dizzy jaunt through philosophy and moral free will in the context of Skaianet Laboratories, while writing an outline as to how to create a Rose Strider AU, while attempting to forecast whether GIF or PNG images will be readable in fifty years, while tossing around a rhythm in my head which might or might not turn into a song, while figuring out what environment variables to set in a bash shell to make it look as much like Homestuck as possible, while doing pixel art to fill in the gaps, while cooking pasta.\n\n...No wait, not all at once. Or the pasta burns and I have to throw it out and start over. It is a thing that has happened more than once, sad to say. But I digress.\n\nI came to Homestuck via following the network of webcomic artists via those piles of links they have, \"these are some other webcomics that are cool\".\n\nI catch up right about [[flash:644|[S] John: Sleep]].\n\n[S] is very cool. I follow that bracketed letter like a Pied Piper, through WV: Ascend, through Rose's entrance and Dave's entrance and the Midnight Crew. I follow it through Descend (which is right around when a certain someone I was close to realized I liked Homestuck more than I did him. Oops, I guess there's a reason I identify as asexual). Idly I venture onto the forums, with fanfiction and speculation and world-building.\n\nThen someone called [[artist:bill-bolin|Bill Bolin]] doesn't want his music in the comic anymore for some reason. So something not entirely unlike this happened:\n\n\"Hey hey isn't that bassline going to have to be replaced?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we'll take care of it.\"\n\n\"Oops. I already made a bassline for you. Here here listen to it.\"\n\n\"That's nice. Now run along.\"\n\n\"Can I do something else maybe? Please? For later?\"\n\n\"Don't push your luck.\"\n\nThis is about when I figured out that yes, there is a thing called the music team and no, they're not accepting applications. Oh well. I just figure I'll keep making music since I started.\n\nAnd then I just never stop.\n\n<hr>\n\nSo this is basically how I came to want to collect this music, polish it. People tend to complain about having to take the time to download the entire fanmusic thread one song at a time - and those people probably don't really have an inkling of how much good is in fanmusic.\n\nThis album is a celebration of fanmusic, yes - but it's also intended as somthing to bring it to more people than would ordinarily venture onto a forum thread, several dozen pages long, in the Art Forum, in the MSPA fan forum, tucked away in a small corner of the Internet.\n\nSo while you're here, I'll say two things:\n\nFirstly, maybe there's something you think you want to do. Maybe you're not good at it, but if you like it, and you practice, and you have people to give you good critical feedback on how good you are at it, it'll become something you're good at. Ask someone who's good at something and they'll say the same thing. (There are exceptions, like six-fingred pianists and seven-foot-tall basketball players. Not often, though.)\n\nAnd secondly, if you don't already know about what Homestuck is before this, maybe you should look. It is a tale of four children, and the beta test of a game put out by a mysterious company. It is a tale of twelve trolls, and two games that turn out to put one in danger of life and limb. It is a tale of four archagents, and a mansion run by a man with a cueball for a head.

Sometimes that fanmusic ends up being non-Nepetaquest related (rare!) and finds its way on to the Fanmusic thread.\n\nThis is not one of those songs.\n\nNear the start of this fanmusic album project [[artist:elaine-wang|orngjce223]] asked for someone to remix [[artist:mk-97|MK_97's]] [[track:homestuck-title-screen|\"Homestuck Title Theme\"]], while incorporating more motifs from Homestuck's music. I decided sure why not? And then this song was born. So Beginnings is a remix of a remix, really. The original was a remix of [[track:skies-of-skaia|\"Skies of Skaia\"]] - I added the motifs from [[track:homestuck|\"Homestuck\"]] and [[track:theme|\"Alternia\"]] because I felt they were representative of the kids' and the trolls' journeys respectively. I mean come on, the title is RIGHT THERE. So yeah.\n\nSince it was a title screen tune, I pretty much drew on what I remembered from game title screens to make it. Really, the only specific influence I can recall is that the piano part at the end was inspired by Kingdom Hearts' title screen tune ([\"Dearly Beloved\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk4P10nsq4c)). I love that song.\n\nFun fact: I didn't realise for a while that \"Homestuck\" and \"Alternia\" were technically remixes themselves, making this a 3x remix-of-remix combob.\n\n<i>Catboss:</i> ([SoundCloud description](https://soundcloud.com/catbossstudio/beginnings), excerpt)\n\n&gt; NEW GAME<br>\nLOAD GAME\n\n<hr>\n\nOne of my two submissions to the Land of Fans and Music album, an unofficial compilation of fanmusic created within the Homestuck fandom. The other submission was [[MeGaDanceVaNia]].\n\nThis was not only the first track on the album, but really the only track that was specifically composed for the album. Or remixed, rather. The initiator of the project, [[artist:elaine-wang|OJ]], requested for a remix to be done of MK_97's [[track:homestuck-title-screen|\"Homestuck Title Screen,\"]] while incorporating more motifs from the comic. I took up that request, and churned this out.\n\nThis song was basically a nostalgia bomb for me; I just had to think back to the days of playing SNES-era RPGs, and what I thought a title screen tune should sound like. Chrono Trigger's [title screen tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU1rM8UYpus), in particular, was a big influence, as was the simple [\"Dearly Beloved\"](www.youtube.com/watch?v=g25QXnhVijQ) from Kingdom Hearts. The chiptune aesthetic certainly helped!"

Problem Sleuth has always held a place in my heart; with the rise of Homestuck, MSPA continues to be a beacon of awesome. I have never before been faced with such a preposterous amount of talent in any fandom, and the MSPA Community continues to grow and evolve in such a way that smashes through any \"threshold\" of artistic creativity. I am inspired, and wish to inspire.\n\nMy knowledge in FL Studio is limited to what I have learned over the years in tinkering with it, to be honest. As such, my composition \"Downtime\" is actually pretty simplistic from a technical standpoint; my teachers have always told me, \"the simpler, the better.\" I have always disliked this sentiment, but reluctantly I've come to understand the necessity of simplicity in my works. My sister - who wishes to be unnamed becuase \"lol, internet\" - was the mastermind behind this piece; I functioned as merely the interpreter to her excellent judgment. I was given the task of weaving [[Showtime (Piano Refrain)|Showtime]] and [[Showdown]] together, and my result became Downtime.\n\nHonestly, I never thought Downtime would receive as much attention as it has, let alone its own place in an awesome fan-music album alongside (in my opinion) better artists than myself. I'm grateful that it's well received, and I hope to continue composing - even if only to inspire those that listen.\n\nThanks, MSPA."

So, I really took my time getting through it, especially Acts 1 and 2.\n\nBy the time I had gotten to the start of Act 4, I was a month behind in the story. However, just hearing [[Doctor]] for the first time completely blew me away, as I'm quite sure MANY fans reacted. The first thing I did? Started making a fan remix. I didn't want to work on it for too long, but I figured I should register and post what I had on the MSPA Forums. It was called a \"First Pwnst\" by [[artist:kristian-anderson|Dacen]], and brought the Music Team's very own [[artist:perry-sullivan|Perry Sullivan]] (perrybob) \"to tears.\" I ended up finishing up the track about a week and a half later, but the release you hear on this album is an improved edit and remaster.\n\nDeep Breeze Mix turned more heads than I had expected it to, and is one of the reasons (with the other being another fan remix-turned official remix) I now am humbly and proudly on the Music Team.\n\nCredit to AndrewNeo of Skaia.net for the track's name."

A long sample of a small mountain stream (mountain streams are melted snow after all). Some pipe and wind samples and string samples, balance the hollow against the warm.\n\nThe first version of the song is done within six hours of [[flash:2988|the flash revealing Jade's land]]. Trying to transcribe directly from Flash is kind of difficult since there is a very inconvenient pause (right-click, uncheck Play; check the box again when you want to start listening again) and no rewind.\n\nThen [[artist:solatrus|Solatrus]] quietly takes me aside and tells me I've latched onto the wrong melody. Oops.\n\nThat fixed, I started piling harmonics on top. Some more pipes, and strings, and a xylophone just to be contrary. Staccato strings are fun.\n\nInitially everything is piled on top, in the center. In revision for the album I pan everything back and forth. It may be noted that this song still sounds perfectly fine in mono, though."

When we first meet her in the Hivebent act, she's an emotionless ghost who later becomes a ghost frog, then a ghost in a robot body (or a \"ghost in the shell\" :rimshot:), before making her final sea change into a cheerful fairy god with time powers (which explains the ticking and subtle reverse melodies of the song, at least). The peppy piano and melancholy backing strings and woodwinds represent these aspects of Aradia's presonality - accustomed to death, she acts as a cheery Charon for her fallen teammates. I built the piano melody (and the title) out of [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti's]] [[Crystalanthemums|\"Crystalanthemums\"]] because to me, ever since [[flash:2578|[S]: Make her pay]], the tune has been irrevocably linked to the trolls, Aradia, Terezi, and Vriska in particular. It also translated to a peppy piano melody much better than Toby Fox's [[psych0ruins|\"psych0ruins\"]] would have.\n\nThis song is also an homage to Michiru Yamane's impressive body of soundtrack work for the various Castlevania games."

It's dreamy topography sucks me in, and before I can protest I've been seated and presented with a wine list. \"Nothing but the finest fermented crude for you\", they say. Well okay. It's not particularly tasty, but it's nice to look at and has a nice finish.\n\nI compose a lot of music for solo instruments, not so much for electronics. When it struck me that I might like to make a tune in tribute of Homestuck, I immediately thuoght of the cobalt vistas of LOWAS. I was playing around with a new tuning at the time (I'm a huge fan of weird guitar stuff) and found that it had the most amazing capabilities for melody and harmony using nothing but Harmonics! Eventually I just hit the right notes at the right time and the piece practically wrote itself.\n\nI'd like to shout out to the Music Squad for being rad bros, and a super relieved thanks to [[artist:eston-schweickart|Silence]] for helping me mix the tune.\n\nTuning: C G Bb F C D\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThere, uh, isn't that much to tell about this piece. I had originally envisioned John sitting with his legs hanging over the edge or something and I have a clearer idea now of what I could have done! But this was back at the start of the project and my art skills were rusty so yeah. Very simple piece. Just the land based off of what we see in the comic, and John."

The overall objective was to remix the themes from the levels of Sonic 3 & Knuckles into music for each troll, a project that is still slowly ongoing.\n\nThis particular theme is for Terezi, based on the [[track:hydro-city-zone-act-2|Hydrocity Zone]] music. I went for a jazzy remix, largely because I felt it tied in well with her prosecutioner thing. I think it's an interesting look at how my abilities have developed since I first wrote the piece - I had to make adjustments just to be satisfied putting it on this album.\n\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nAs it happens, drawing giant sky neurons is incredibly fun. Ancient runined temples, not so much fun and also incredibly difficult to shade right, but there you go. I am ashamed I did not manage to work in any Sonic the Hedgehog references, though."

              "Commentary": "<i>Ian White:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nLand of Wrath and Angels was a melody that I had been ignoring for about a year now. I brought it up when we were trying to hash out some Troll leitmotifs and instruments for the Hivebent Radioplay (remember when that was a thing?) It was for Eridan(!) I guess I liked the idea of him pining over a giant pipe organ cause he thought that's what evil guys are supposed to do whenever they get scorned, by girls usually. I myself felt the sick sting of scorn when [[artist:kristian-anderson|Dacen]] suggested an accordion or French horn might suit Eridan better. WELL FUCK YOU DACEN. LoWaA was the last in a series of 12 short songs I made for the Troll Planets. It was actually revealed a solid 4 or 5 months after the other 11, so I really wanted to make it stand out as the big finale of my (kind of pointless) musical excursion. I'm also lazy though so I just rehashed an old melody I had lying around. Then I threw in some rocking guitar and pounding drums and angry synths and called it a day. At some point I realized that the initial melody kind of gets lost in the balance, so I repeated it at the end all clear and pretty-like with harps and clarinets, which actually turned out to be my favourite part of the song, so yay.\n\nMud Fact: I wrote the second part of the melody when I was 12 and trying to play the Castlevania 4 theme by ear. I was kind of dumb when I was 12.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nLoWaA was the first piece where I started to get creative. I saw a really cool looking LoWaA on DevArt and wanted to replicate the gothic atmosphere it created with the same color scheme. So I came up with this. A cathedralesque building in the foreground with Eridan sneaking around and a collection of other buildings in the back with Angels looking for him."

And to me, ruins are really really awesome.\n\nI went into \"Ruins of Rajavihara\" with the intent of creating a piece of music one might hear in the \"ruins\" level fo a videogame; solemn and full of mystery while still sounding pretty cool and fast-paced. Rajavihara is a beautifully overgrown temple in Cambodia, and there are a lot of influences from that part of the world in the piece, from instrument choice to rhythm and tune.\n\nI hope this music invokes the ruins in Homestuck, from the Frog Temples to the many strange structures scattered across each Land. These are some of my favorite features in the comic, and I wanted to create something cool for them.\n\n<i>Mal McGannon:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis is a slick song, and I have to say I liked it a lot when I first heard it. But it didn't ring out to me as a frog ruins song, which I feel like it might have been intended to be; instead, I got very vivid images from LOFAF in my mind. So when I 1) saw this song needed art and 2) stumbled across the fact that 2a) Rajavihara is a real place and 2b) [[artist:andrew-hussie|Hussie]] used it as LOFAF scenery in [[flash:3001|Jade: STRIFE!!!!!!!]], it was only logical that I take a picture of the real ruins (thanks Wikipedia!) and do some poor hue shifting and dodging and burning to it as \"art\".\n\nAlso, I drew those flowers. But that doesn't really matter. This song is what matters, and this song is really, really, really really good. So stop reading my drivel and close your eyes and soak it in!"

It was for this AU thing I was doing, in which Kanaya Maryam was a super secret spy having to break into the Big Boss Sollux's base with Karkat as an informer. That didn't pan out though, but I still managed to make this beauty. It's heavily, heavily inspired by Yoko Kanno, my favorite composer. The idea is that the first half is when she's sneaking about going through, knowing that this is important, THIS IS SERIOUS, and she can't risk it here. She stumbles upon a computer, with a typewriter as a keyboard for whatever reason, and then the alarm goes off she gets caught and the big bad chase action scene starts. I had worked on it for about a month, and I kept losing progress because of crashes, but [[artist:eston-schweickart|Silence]] convinced me to finish it, and boy am I glad he did.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nA nice, simple piece. Fashion in Homestuck is associated with Kanaya in my mind so I came up with the idea of Kanaya seeking to escape something, and then halfway through the song the klaxon alarm kicks in. Thus we get this piece of art."

(I'm a big fan.) Another thing I'm a big fan of is [[artist:erik-scheele|Jit]] and his music, because Jit's mad talented. So when I was in the shower one morning (where I do my best thinking) and I had the idea for a Midnight Crew cover of Jit's song from [[album:the-felt]], [[track:the-broken-clock|\"The Broken Clock\"]], I filed it away under \"future stuff to do\", because it's rare I have what I consider a good idea with regards to composition.\n\nSo I worked for quite a while on this: improvising on piano, listening to Drawing Dead over and over and analyzing the different styles of each instrument, writing things down, plugging them into my computer, hating it, writing new parts, adding material, cutting material, hating it more, et cetera, ad infinitum. The final result is still something I'm not completely happy with, but I think I can declare it as done as it'll ever be. So, I hope you enjoy it, and the rest of the first ever Homestuck Fan Album!\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nWhen drawing this I learned that I can't draw clocks well in perspective, so I googled a clock and Photoshopped it in.

I came up with a remix that was a 20 second 8-bit loop track based on [[Sburban Jungle]]. I added the bridge and fadeout at a later time to make it nicer to listen to on its own.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nI have always liked silhouette pieces. I knew that I wanted to draw John running. I briefly considered doing all four kids but decided against it, Sburban Jungle is John's theme after all, and the color scheme would look better with just him. From there it was a simple matter of posing him and arranging the rest of the piece. I think that this is one of the ones I am most proud of, even if it's very simple."

My original plan was to make it a sad, slow song with the theme I'd come up with; at least that's what it sounded like it should do in my head. But when I showed the theme to people, the replies were all that it sounded piratey. So that was the new direction I decided to take, and eventually I ended up with Prince of Seas. Little bit of trivia; originally I'd named it Jack (after Jack Sparrow), but of course that wouldn't have fit into Homestuck at all... so I just modified Eridan's title.\n\nI'd originally written this before Eridan had any sort of theme for his character... and before he, uh, went off the deep end. So when it starts off, it's proud! It's powerful! Wwho is this Eridan you speak of? I am Dualscar, terror of the Alternian Seas, annihilator of the land-dwwellers! However, the middle section emphasizes the real him; a guy plagued by too many FEELINGS and PROBLEMS. But ha, he won't take any of THAT lying down, no sir! /explosive finale\n\n<i>crepuscularDissembler:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis was made using some very ancient techniques, by which I mean mspaint and a mouse. The drawing is very busy in terms of shapes and lines, so I tried to keep the palette simple.\n\nI intended this to have a bit of an iconic feel (note the orange halo formed by the clouds)."

Just saying this in case you accidentally clicked on this pdf and got lost.\n\nBut anyway, I guess I should talk about my track 'Jackie Treats'. The initial creation, or rather, remixing, of this track started - as far as I can remember - when I began messing around with one of the melodies of from [[track:liquid-negrocity|'Liquid Negrocity']], which is probably one of my favourite pieces off [[album:midnight-crew-drawing-dead|the Midnight Crew album]].\n\nI created quite a neat little piano piece, which is heard at around 0:59 to 1:10. This is pretty much what helped me get into a rhythm for the song, and before I kenw it I began composing around it. It was probably towards the very end of the song, when I added the jazz organ into the piece that made me think of 'Bec Noir' having horrible thoughts concerning dog treats. So I decided to name the WIP track 'Jackie Treats' (The name kinda stuck).\n\nLastly, I needed to improve the intro. It was bad or something. So I decided to mix in [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] to help create a little symbolism here and there about BN and Jade's relationship.\n\n<i>Pancake-Fairy:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nI drew the picture this way because the track was inspired by the Snausages page where Bec feels love towards Jade. In this piece he's putting his trust in Jade as she is holding said treats, meanwhile Dave is sneaking up behind him for an attack."

I don't really have much to say about it, I was fucking around on my keyboard one day and played those chords you hear and thought \"yeah sure that sounds good\" (I have no fucking clue about chord progression or any other technical shit). I added the stuff at the beginning next because it sounded weird just jumping right into the chords. The drums are a combination of a preset that comes with Fruity Loops with a filter over it and a sampled drum loop I had lying around with some echo and reverb. The drums near the end are some more samples I threw into a slicer and distorted.\n\nI don't really have a plan or anything when I make a song, so whatever happens kinda just happens, which is probably why I have nothing to say here. But either way I'm flattered that people even wanted me on this album so thanks for letting me join this project.\n\n<i>Elaine Wang:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nSkaian air is Skaian air.

There is a lot of contrasting dynamics thrown in, supposed to be reminiscent of his split personality. The piano line where both hands are playing sixteenth notes near the end is my favorite part.

              "Commentary": "<i>Isoraķatheð Zorethan F.:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nWell, what have we... Felt (SI: HS\\\\MUS:B0) got me thinking about time signatures, and also lumping multiple together. This is the fruition of this endeavor. Granted, it's not any good, but this may be the one piece where you have a 30/30 time signature (4/4 overlay 5/5 overlay 6/8). It's a little bit tired; stumbling; drunk... much like the first time when I first found this comic, I would assume. That was about two years ago.\n\n(On an unrelated note, this applies to table tennis very well.)\n\n<i>Isoraķatheð Zorethan F.:</i> (wiki communications over email, excerpt)\n\nHello.\n\nMaibasojen[1] is a piece of music that I made as part of a long-ago project to make 26 pieces, one for each of the alphabet.[2] It turns out that at the time I was really into Homestuck, and also I learnt about hemiola[3] and thought that the time-warping nature kind of felt similar to whatever mess the Felt was doing, so the idea was that I put the two together and tried to work that in as a submission. I remember distinctly that it was almost meant to be discarded from the list because it doesn't feel particularly Homestuck,[4] but clearly it made it in the end.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some specific tangents:\n\n[1] Sometimes the B, S and J are flopped around each other because the name has never really been fixed; pronunciation is IPA except that &lt;j> is /ʔ/.\n\n[2] The entire album is called Palokrai and is cut into two parts. The reference to the alphabet was not planned out at first; instead the first few pieces I wrote just happened to avoid each other by first letter and I thought to continue that down that road until it ends. Letters are picked without decision. As described later, M is picked 3rd from the end. Looking at the album art of the others, it appears that the box at the bottom is to ensure that the presence of the box and the colour together uniquely determine which song in the album it is.\n\nI *believe* that every piece has a four-syllable name, and if it won't fit on one line in the default font then it's split into two visually. There is however never a space in the name.\n\n[3] The three-against-two pattern which forms the primary impetus in the piece; I actually first heard it as a sample on Wikipedia and I thought it was probably good enough to continue as a whole song. Later on quintuplets show up for a 2:3:5 polyrhythm. At the time, I did not know the words \"hemiola\", \"quintuplets\" or \"polyrhythm\", and so the concept looked mysterious; now less so of course, and I would have approached it slightly differently. I was lacking in music theory knowledge, ironically enough.\n\n[4] The idea of making fanart subtle enough that it doesn't scan as such at first pass as such continues today in my current creative output - a lot of it is technically \"fanart\" but it has so many things that are distinctly *me*-shaped that it never looks like it. Also to conform to my creative limitations they aren't really visual art.\n\nAdditionally, the polyrhythm is what the grey figure represents. Every song in Palokrai has one of these in the album cover. The pair of axes I forget what the axes represent, but only what kind of quality each one has relative to each other.\n\n===\n\nI have had no idea what \"(SI: HS\\\\MUS:B0)\" would refer to at all; I never recalled writing it. The lime numbers shows that it is a piece of music (3), and it's the 23rd piece I've made that lives in this categorisation system, and it's the audio version (2). The sheet music version, which I have considered to be the authoritative one with the audio version being a digestible alternative, would be No. 3.23.01. Nowadays I use a different categorisation system - two actually - and basically can't keep up with this one.\n\n===\n\nAs you do note it's been a duodecade since the piece, and if I want to explore the idea of \"time-warping music\" I now have more theory to back it up. It would be xenharmonic and xenrhythmic and backed by ideas that I developed during my time with my own conworlds too. Would I do it? Probably not, and almost certainly not as a \"Homestuck fan-music\" as I don't remember a whole bunch and looking things up is sure to bring up some embarrassing (though ultimately harmless!) memories."

Just that I tried to keep the instrumentals light and non-distracting, but still true to the original cockney pastiche.\n\n<i>Goatmon:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nI feel like I really can't take credits for this song. The lyrics came from Something Awful, and the music is from a midi that [[artist:nic-carey|Tynic]] scrounged up from somewhere. Someone at the Penny Arcade MSPA thread mentioned having seen a supercalifrag parody at Something Awful, and after Googling I found the lyrics, and decided to try my hand at it. Tynic volunteered her voice, and after she got the midi accompaniment, we bounced back and forth with it until it was the right key and speed. From there she recorded her part and I did mine, etc.\n\nTo this day, I don't really like listening to myself in this song, I just don't think it came out how I wanted it. That doesn't seem to matter to everyone else, though. I never imagined it could have taken off like it did, but it very quickly spread and apparently became a thing.\n\nI'd always hoped that I'd eventually come out with some Homestuck thing that would be well remembered by the fans. Here I was wasting my time whipping together silly mario paints, when I should have been recording catchy songs about amoral abusive relationships. Live and learn."

I decided to make adaptations of Homestuck tunes for classical guitar, and they both translated surprisingly well for the most part. This particular rendition of [[Explore]] is based off the version from [[Descend]], which is in C Minor as opposed to the A Minor of the original. Explore forever has an association with ectobiology because the scene where it plays in Descend is of Egbert sending babies onto meteors.\n\nFor the album, I added reverb onto the orginal, which I felt was a little too dry due to being recorded with an acoustic-electric guitar plugged directly into a mixer. I tried to make the reverb sound like somebody playing guitar in the Veil labs; whether or not I succeeded in doing so is up to the listener's ears.\n\n<i>tT Twigwise:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nWhen I first saw the title, 'Hymn of Making Babies,' my mind appropriately jumped to our resident Ectobiologist, John. And listening to the track doesn't disappoint, either! The cover that EnnuiKing did is both a mix of sombre, almost Medieval playing, and then downright goofy John-ness at the end, and I wanted to try and get that. At first glance, this picture is a little serious and a little solemn, and then you realize... this is John Egbert that's the subject matter here, and that just makes it incredibly silly because, well, in the end, wouldn't he just go so over-the-top dramatic in this situation? Yeah. Probably."

Songs on that album, particularly [[Sunslammer]], were my main inspiration.\n\nI put the song on Tindeck once it was finished, and without linking it anywhere, I found that it had over 200 hits the next day (I'm still not sure how this happened, though I suspect [[artist:ian-white|MyUsernamesMud]] had something to do with it). Months later, it is still my best-known song, and one of my proudest musical accomplishments.\n\n<i>kayak:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis was the first piece of fanmusic I had ever listened to and it blew my mind.

Generally in music, crystalline landscapes are given reverb laden atmospheres with bells and other instruments with a resonant sound. In this piece, I used the instrumentation of handbells, a piano, some synth string and choir background, and drum kit, the two prominent instrmuments being the piano and bells. The bells worked to set the atmosphere while piano handled melody. Then everything got doused in reverb. So much reverb. Maybe the reverb has reverb. But voila. This is one of my favorites from before I was on the music team.\n\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nSo many layers, so much transparency, but I think it worked out quite well.

The inspiration from Professor Layton, drawing from video game themes, also effected my choice to make this loop(able).\n\nHouse of Lalonde was always intended from the start to be the theme for some sort of home. Orginally, it was going to be for Doc Scratch's study... but the only reason that never happened was because I couldn't find the right organ sound (the kind you hear in [[Scratch]]). So, scrapping that idea, I continued to set about sculpting a theme for a sophisticated abode, and eventually reached the conclusion that it would work rather well for Rose's.

I wrote the beginning of a song at the beginning of Hivebent called Lusus' Lament. It was supposed to be like a [[Chorale for Jaspers]] but for the trolls' custodians. This was before I even knew [[album:alternia]] was in the works. After hearing [[psych0ruins]] I loved those beginning arpeggios and crying effect. So when [[artist:toby-fox|Rad]] mentioned the idea of having troll planet themes, I jumped at the chance of making one for Aradia. I used the beginning to Lusus' Lament and then combined it with those beginning arpeggios and the first phrases of psych0ruins.\n\nAradia's planet is the Land of Quartz and Melody, so I ran with the music box motif and added glockenspiel for a crystal-esque noise. The beginning section is kind of like what [[Sburban Jungle]] is to Rose. Music to add to her trying to enter the medium. There is a pause as she succeeds and enters and the mood of the music shifts completely. The second half builds more of the Quartz feel.\n\nThe title is because Nick thought we should have a foreign name.\n\n<i>umibouzu:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nI picked up \"L'état de L'ambivalence\" before I knew what it was about. When I found out it was an Aradia land theme, I kind of panicked. Backgrounds and scenery are a huge weakness of mine, and I wasn't soure how to depict LOQAM without essentially copying the existing art, so I decided to focus more on Aradia herself."

The whole time I was making it I had [DJ School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hulzQrLfvmM) from Rhythm Heaven stuck in my head, which is another cutesy song about another pair of cool dudes who are also learning to scratch records. So I guess I stole that. They probably weren't brothers though on account of how one was blue and the other was a robot I think. Lemmings had an influence too, which is to say that's where I stole those high-pitched bleeps from. I didn't even think to use [[track:beatdown-strider-style|Beatdown]] for the melody until I had prety much built the rest of the song around it. I had an old midi (by [[artist:steve-everson|Tenebrais]] I think) and started goofing around trying to play it out in a major key and it fit pretty well sooooo that's that story.\n\nAlso I have no idea what record scratching actually sounds like so I just downloaded a bunch of cheesy \"dj sound fx\" and tried to make a cool rhythm out of them. That little breakdown in the middle is supposed to be Bro playing a line and then Dave answering. Then they trade off some more. Then they both start playing at the same time, like back to back or something cool like that, and then it goes back to the main melody. Did I make that obvious enough? Maybe I should've made Bro a bit louder in the left speaker and Dave a bit louder in the right. Actually hold on I'm going to go do that.\n\n<i>umibouzu:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThere was pretty much no way I was not going to jump on \"Growin' Up Strider.\" I love Dave (and Bro).

Afer showing an early draft to [[artist:alex-rosetti|Alex Rosetti]], he offered to supply some more miscellaneous naks.

It had to be something that could capture both the quirkyness of a kid playing make believe and hardboiled grittiness of a police chase/standoff. It's one part Phoenix Wright, another part film noir and big band jazz and some funky cop chase thrown in for good measure. The 8-bit version was the first one I made. If the 8-bit version is the saccharine topping of the cake, then [[track:vigilante-cornered|Cornered]] is its seedy underbelly, burnt to a crisp at the bottom of the pan."

It was amazing and, more relevant to this commentary, it reminded me that not only did I once have an interest in composition, I still had some music software installed.\n\nArmed with one synthesizer and inspired by Doc Scratch, I sat down and wrote [[Inevitable End]] in one sitting. I didn't know what a scale was, I was clueless about mixing and the basics of song structure eluded me completely, but with enough trial and error it somehow came out okay.\n\nSeven months later, I decided to revisit Inevitable End and see if I couldn't make it a little better and a lot more deliberate. A War of One Bullet represents my everlasting journey from directionless experimentation to conscious design, and even thugh I have a long way to go it's worth stopping to listen to the singing roses now and then, because if you don't enjoy your work, who will?\n\n<i>Quirk:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThere wasn't much to this one, I'm afraid. Image search + 9mm bullet pic + Doc Scratch template + GIMP = ART.\n\nThat's some solid mathematics there. You can take that to the bank. The math bank.\n\nPlus it's a fun visual metaphor for the song title."

The saxaphone sounded like Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth, so I experimented with slathering reverb on it. I came across a preset that made it sound like the saxophone in [\"Audrey's Theme\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF43b38k0Mw) from Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks score, and decided that this was the new direction I wanted for the song. Towards the end, it features tremolo picking, which I feel is my signature guitar technique since it's the only one I can pull off that sounds remotely impressive.\n\nThe name of the song doubles as an excellent echeladder rung name for Karkat. I picture him reaching the rung and being really confused by it until way after his Sgrub sesion, when its true meaning became apparent.\n\n<i>kayak:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis song sounds like something you might tango to, so I wanted the pose to initially look like they were dancing, but then Kanaya's blood and limp frame sink in. I thought Kan's red skirt and jade blod coinciding with roses made a beautiful limited color scheme. I also didn't want too much detail to tip the moment too far into silly or somber, as it really is both at the same time."

So I genuinely thought I was doing a rock cover of a synth-rock song and didn't mess with the instrumentation or anything else too drastically. Kinda wish I had in retrospect for differentiation's sake.\n\nStrangely, the guitar used to record this broke shortly after doing so, followed by a massive string of equipment failures with my studio setup, so I wasn't capable of redoing the track for this release. I blame using a seven-string for is now apparently an eight-string's song and somehow getting cursed with horrible luck. Alas, you can't blame fictional children on an insurance claim.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\n[[track:MeGaLoVania]] + Rock. A potent combination when mixed! A similar yet more complex piece when compared to [[track:a-fashionable-escape|Fashionable Escape]]. Both had characters that I cut out of the panel and edited to fit my purposes. I really do like how this one turned out though. My original draft had curtains on each side of her. I went back and cut them out though. I thought \"okay, it's metal, there should be smoke\". The lights were already in place so when I added the smoke effect I was awed by the effect it had. From there I touched things up and added Vriska's background lights. ::::)"

The original name for this piece was Homestuck Medley 1, since I planned on writing more like it before I realized what a ridiculous idea that was. (I actually got pretty far on number 2 before giving up.)\n\n[[artist:brad-griffin|Avi]] suggested that I rename it \"Growing Up,\" and I liked that title much better, since the song is reminiscent of someone (most likely John) reflecting on childhood memories, both good and bad. Avi also suggested names related to the four quadrants of troll romance. Before that point, I hadn't considered it, but the song could certainly be interpreted as musical representations of the auspitice, the moirail, the matesprit, and the kismesis.\n\nThough, admittedly, the original motivation behind the piece was to see how many stylse I could shove together and still end up with something vaguely coherent.\n\n<i>Cheers:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nAs soon as I listened to this song, I knew I had to draw the artwork for it. To me, it clearly represented the passage from childhood to maturity that each of the kids, especially John, were forced to undergo in their short-lived session. Focusing on our favourite Friend-Leader, I attempted to capture this with an image of him turning his back on the relative safety and comforts of childhood and the watchful eye of his guardian."

The song is a build-up to each of the four kids entering the Medium (they're being \"drawn\" into the game just as Eddie, Susannah, and Jake were drawn into Mid-World, but that's enough for now about something that isn't Homsetuck), so we start out with a slow rendition of [[Sburban Jungle|\"Sburban Jungle\"]] played on the piano (John's instrument) with subsequent accompaniment by a violin (Rose's instrument). Then, here come the drums (Dave's instrument), and we kick the song into high gear when the flute and bass (both Jade's instruments) come in. There's a long period of pseudo-improv from the bass, flute, and violin before returning to the meat of the song - and a nod to the [[Squiddles!|Squiddles]] theme (another reference to Rose) before the finale. Curiously, the order of the instruments exactly matches the order of the kids' introduction."

Just kidding, that didn't happen. Maybe. Anyways, this song was really fun to make. I tried a lot of crazy sound-manipulation things I'd never really tried before for the breakdown and outro, and I really feel like I succeeded with them! The main theme that happens on the rhodes is really fun to play, and might become a prominent theme later...? Either way, I hope you like this song as much as I do! Much love from Kali, thank you for listening!\n\n<i>catastrophicGenesis:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThe window outline is taken from the Christ Church cathedral in Oxford and originally depicts St Cecilia. Several million free-select clicks later, my wrist was dead and this was the result. The stark colour scheme is a result of trying to make it look suitably dramatic."

Both of them evolved quite a bit since first compsing them in MIDI.

Farewell was originally intended to accompany the scene where John discovered Mom and Dad were dead. At this point in the story it could have gone any way, so I started playing around and doing improvisations based around the [[track:showtime-piano-refrain|Showtime]] theme, being a theme central to John. After messing around some more for a while I realised that a more bittersweet touch worked better though, and that instead of being used for lamenting, in my minds eye the piece seemed to fit something more akin to a goodbye, such as a scene displaying the kids and trolls parting ways.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i> (booklet commentary)\n\nThis piece is based on what I hope will happen (still). After joining forces to defeat Jack, the kids' ultimate reward is unlocked and the trolls either go back to their own world, or accompany the kids. John is the last to leave and you can see the shadows of Terezi and Karkat. John gives a final wave before stepping through the door, Karkat gives a last farewell gesture in response. A bittersweet ending indeed."

However, one stormy winter night as I slept curled up in my cave, the spirit of a great troll came to me...\n\nHold on, I think I have the wrong story.\n\nAnyway, shortly before Christmas, a friend of mine suggested in passing that perhaps I could put my musical talents to some practical use in the context of Homestuck, which he'd recently managed to convince me to read and I'd become instantly hooked on. We tossed around a few ideas and eventually came up with the idea of stringing together the land themes of the four kids to create some sort of medley. Unfortunately it was a fairly busy time for me, with lots of projects requiring my immediate attention.\n\nHowever, as Christmas approached, I made the decision to inform all my clients that I would be taking time off writing music for a few weeks to \"celebrate the holidays\", which in actual fact resulted in the creation of this arrangement!\n\nHope you enjoy!"

What inspired me most is how emotional and nostalgic it felt, even with just a few long notes and a simple bassline. I wanted to replicate that. You don't need to write something complicated to express a deep feeling. When something is simple, it's easy to capture your pure expression. And so I think this is a sincere song."

I actually created this for a fan-album called [[album:i-miss-you-earthbound-2012|\"I Miss You\"]] as an attempt at creating an original \"Game Over\" theme. My main inspiration was the Game Over theme from Zelda 1. I liked how strangely soothing it felt.\n\nSomeone recently asked me how I create songs that fit the characters and scenarios in the game so perfectly. Well, given the fact that some of them weren't created for UNDERTALE... I actually think I'm just good at using the fact that the human mind loves to make associations. Whatever you hear first in a scenario will be the thing that \"fits.\""

[[track:sans|\"Sans\"]] was also a song in the game called \"Muscles,\" and [[track:heartache|\"Heartache\"]] was a song called \"Joker Battle.\" Anyway, I always mess up playing this song on the piano, so if you can't play it, it's not a big deal. Since it's Papyrus, it's OK as long as you try your best."

There was a period where I played this song nearly every day on the piano, dreaming about the game I had not finished yet...\n\nHowever, my wrists have some kind of problem now, so I can't play the piano for very long anymore. That's OK though. Anyway, once you learn this song, be sure to play it any way you like. Express yourself. But, you must make sure that your self-expression doesn't destroy your body.\n\nPS - It's irrelevant to the piano version, but the way I arranged it in game is inspired by the band [[artist:anamanaguchi|Anamanaguchi]]."

So, I did! I tried to evoke the same feelings as the [[album:homestuck-for-the-holidays]] cover without seeming too derivative, so I had the kids take a \"backseat\" and have a huge cruxite tree with eponymous grist hanging from it be center stage. The result: a peaceful and quiet scene in LOFAF, representing the best of the Gristmas season. (There are four emotes hidden throughout the image. Good luck finding them!)",

The first was to make at least part of it feel like one of those classic 80s Christmas songs that everyone loves, a la Wham!. The second was to make it feel like the in-betweens of the holiday experience: after the unwrapping of presents or whichiver main celebration applies, in the midst of the gathering, before everyone's said their goodbyes and while the spirit of holiday cheer still remains. A theme you could have a cup of hot chocolate to while engaging a seldom-seen relative in lighthearted conversation.\nWhether I succeeded in these things is up to you. But in any case, I had a whole lot of fun making this!"

The melody always struck me from the beginning as rather festive-feeling, even if it didn't use the standard musical tropes for Christmas music, so I took this idea and set out to make the most Christmassy electronic music I could make.\nThe lyrics also only rather obliquely reference Homestuck; it's never mentioned by name, I chose the most mild-sounding aspects of the story to directly reference, and not once is conksuck or shit lets be santa dropped. But most importantly, the lyrics are for you, dear Homestuck reader, as a reminder that though the year has come to a close, though the act is ending, the future still holds many more in store for you. Your story continues on, so be its hero!"

If that’s the case, this song might sound familiar because it actually appeared in there for a bit.\n\nIts full name is “The King in Red”, and its supposed to be this weird pseudo-classical apocalyptic black metal remix of [[Karkat's Theme]]. The reason I never finished this up is because I was pretty dissatisfied with the choir samples, which simply weren’t up to the task.\n\nHuman voice is said to be the single hardest thing to emulate through samples, which I guess is because people are generally used to hearing human voices all the time, so they’re much more likely to pick up on stuff that sounds ‘off’ than in the case of, for example, a sampled hurdy gurdy.\n\nIn a lot of ways, it’s kinda similar to the uncanny valley problem with visual art; making a convincing and realistic human face through 3D modelling is very hard to pull off, and I don’t think it’s been seriously attempted since the Final Fantasy movie (And we all know how that turned out for them).\n\nEven modern CGI movies like Avatar avoid the concept by creating a distinctly alien race that gets just enough humanlike features to make them look relatable and 'cute’."

This one is for Jack who is possessed by Lord English, so it uses a bit of the melody from [[Black|“Black”]]. It also borrows quite a bit from [[Thin RED Line|Arakune’s Theme]] from the game Blazblue. I tried to give it a bit of a neoclassical feel in the same way as [[Dance of Thorns|“Dance of Thorns”]]."

The delicious fruit of my all-day drawing marathon.\n\nThe music team put together a free* holiday album as a thank-you to the MSPA community and asked if I would donate a cover illustration! It was unfortunately rushed, and is just BEGGING for me to keep working on it, but I already made them wait all day and couldn't justify continuing to be a terrible person.\n\nI had the privilege of listening to it in advance and it is an excellent compilation. So download it and be jolly!\n\nHappy Holidays, everyone!\n\nHomestuck and its characters belong to [[artist:andrew-hussie]].\n\n*Apparently bandcamp has limited free downloads, which have already been exceeded! Fortunately, all proceeds go to Child's Play! So the meager amount you shell out for this is for a very good cause.",

But only one of the years that there has been in all of history has had a baby born who, inside of him, has had all the powers of a higher deity. It is on this god-child's birthday that everyone, more or less, will gather around with their families and buy expensive things for people they love dearly. Now, we in the Incipisphere celebrate Christmas too, oh no no no don't get me wrong, we love Christmas. But our Christmasses are a little bit different. You see, our Christmas time festivities don't have a-a Frosty o-or a Rudolph, because we don't accept the Christmas apocrypha as canonical, and we don't own radios because of how poor we are. So we don't know what a Frank Sinatra or-or a Bing Crosby is. But if you point your ears at the sky and listen, real real careful, on Christmas morning, you might just hear us Skaians singing our Christmas Carol.)"

In fact, it's only about 365 days left until the next big day! And in Santa time, that's only a few seconds. So kids, be good, and maybe next year Santa will bring you something extra special in the name of that magic infant from the very first year of modern days. And don't forget about us up here in the Incipisphere either, because children, we're always here to help. We're always looking out for you!)\n\n(Oh, it's time to get back to work!

      "Commentary": "<i>Michael Guy Bowman:</i>\n<i>Experimental aircraft, lost civilizations, mythic quests, the Philippines, true love, utter loss, and the transience of life - the many subjects of Ithaca, the first independently released Bowman album. Scattergun in its genre and chaotically retro in its fashion, Ithaca is an eclectic mix of songs both personal and abstract. Bowman once again brings his familiar voice and ever-changing production style along with several friends from the Homestuck music project and elsewhere. Ithaca is calling.</i>\nAfter spending years making music exclusively for Homestuck, I branched out with 2012's Ithaca, my first independently released album. Following up on my album-within-a-web-comic [[album:mobius-trip-and-hadron-kaleido]], I moved away from my palette of digital synths to focus on a classic rock style. Out come the guitars, the bass, the little toy harp. Shades of Eno, Bowie, The Beatles, Pink Floyd, even a swing tune. It's a freaky affair.\nThe ideas came from everywhere. There's a song based on something I heard in a dream when I was eight years old, ([[Old Buggy Now]]). There's one about an engineer who falls in love with an experimental aircraft ([[Tacit Blue]]). There's a carriage ride through a Manila's Chinatown district ([[Kalesa In Binondo]]). The title track [[Ithaca]] recalls Odysseus, a bowman himself. All of it is peppered with guest contributions from Internet friends.",

That's 26 and 17 arts respectively! They can be said unironically to have saved the art part of this album.\nThe other artists are fine too but they didn't make 17 track arts and that's the cutoff for being personally mentioned...\n<i>Ucklin:</i>\nThanks: Circlejourney and Makin for helping with management and organization, Kanishka for working a lot to get the booklet ready, Gryotharian for giving feedback to almost every song on the spreadsheet, and everyone else on the team who took on roles to help us get this out in addition to their music and art contributions! Also, everyone who tuned in to [the livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz6uitzoTgU).\nI thought this would definitely be our final album going in, but now I don't feel so sure.

Time flies.\nSpacetime Starstriker was also the second track of its original release platform. It was first published through a different music team (am I allowed to name CANMT here?). At the time, I think I was mainly excited about the track's aggressive time signature changes.\nOver the years, I've assembled a laundry list of things I'd change in the piece if I were to start again from scratch. But I'm still proud of the original product, and grateful for the reception thus far. I feel content with this being my last major contribution to the HS fanmusic space. For the time being.\nMany of the motifs and quotes in this track are lifted from CANMT tracks. What a fun group! Those folks helped me get into music-making in the first place, and I most certainly would not be here without them. I encourage you to check out some of the more experimental albums we released. They're more interesting to me than the Greatest Hits compilations, anyhow."

The original plan for the song was just going to be a straightforward beatdown remix, but I liked what I made too much to relegate it to that, and also really wanted to reference [[album:the-baby-is-you|The Baby Is You]], so thus was born this shitpost of a song.\nI hope the art reflects that energy too.

              "Commentary": "<i>Gryotharian:</i>\nThis is a really weird one for me. Originally, I started out with the intention to do a remastered and updated version of my track \"[[The Puppetmaster]]\" from our previous release [[album:friendsymphony|Friendsymphony]], but slowly, I came to realize that the remaster kind of sucked, and all traces of it were eventually wiped from this track. The intro (can you call it in intro if it's more than half the song?) came to me about half a year after the main body of the song, it was the first thing I ever recorded vocals for, and may well be the last. Not much point in putting lyrics down though, cause all they are is \"ooOOOOooo\". I was listening to a lot of Colin Stetson's music during the time I made it so that probably played some influence in it. Then another half year after that I replaced the main body of the song too, because after listening to it with fresh ears, it was kind of a discordant mess. I kept the original idea behind [[The Puppetmaster]], a distorted mix of [[WORST END|Worst End]] and [[English]], but that's about it. I might release that version eventually, but it won't be on this album.\nThis was some of the first non-pixel digital art I ever did, and for that, I think it turned out pretty well. However, I had a real knack for doing things the hardest possible way, and oh my god, I never want to draw another clock again. I did all of this, with a keyboard and trackpad, on a free trial for a photoshop knockoff. That wallpaper? I didn't figure out how to use the copy-paste tool properly, and had to manually put in every detail on it. This was a nightmare to complete, (albeit a nightmare of my own making), so you all had better appreciate it."

Very briefly, it was going to be a Vriska and Eridan track, using all different instruments, but it wasn't working well, and as soon as I switched it to the piano samples, the rest of the song just basically created itself, becoming a whole new vibe that was very The Felt, and not at all Vriska and Eridan."

I did my best to capture in the song the grandness of Alternia, its sinister nature, and Doc Scratch's effect on the planet and this is what I got.I spent a while trying to come up with a name and eventually landed on either Blood Rite or Blood Right, either way it's sort of a pun so take that how you will.\n<i>swanfire:</i>\nDecided to focus on the handmaid and the condesce because of the female laughs in the track and also because they basically shaped the blood based society of alternia as it is.

While I had a lot of fun making that album, over the years I've come to regard its composition and instrumentation as somewhat amateurish; I was still rather new to Famitracker, the software I used to make all those songs.\nWhile I had at one point wanted to remake the entire album using the chiptune skills I know today, the only song I ever ended up remaking was \"[[Madame Controversielle]]\", the album's song for Vriska. The remake was put on the CANMT album \"troleplanet\", and the reasoning behind its title was simply to take the original one and slap a 2 on it! So yes, there is indeed a Madame Controversielle 1, but I really don't get why you would want to listen to it over this version.\n<i>Gryotharian:</i>\nI'm not sure about how this one turned out. All the chiptune and vriska definitely made me think of like, a retro game player select screen, so I went back to my old pixel art style, and tried to fill it with the most vriska that vriska could vriska. But it had been a while since I was working with plain pixel art again, and that probably shows."

I wanted to do something specifically for the offscreen period between the end of homestuck and the epilogues, his journey to becoming what he is now, his acceptance of becoming the villain, etc. Mainly, just really love Dirk. Also, it's an excuse to give some love to some of his more underrated songs. (Basically anything that isn't [[Beatdown (Strider Style)|Beatdown]].) I had never even heard [[Austin, Atlantis|Austin Atlantis]] before I started on this song, and man was I missing out, so it quickly became the basis for the whole thing. In retrospect I wish I could've put [[Orange Hat]] in there somewhere, mainly just cause that's also an awesome underrated song, but by the time I remembered, this was mostly done and it wouldn't have really fit anywhere. This might be the song I'm happiest with on this album."

[[Rex Duodecim Angelus]] in all it's dark neo-classical glory seemed like the perfect track to arrange in this style, though I only kept the original melodies and ideas from it so I wouldn't have to go down a rabbit hole of character themes that could derail the intent of the arrangement. The ending section is inspired by another IP entirely (if you can guess what it is I did a fine enough job), but it seemed appropriate given the context. Very happy with how it turned out! Also the title is pretty long winded but I wanted to fit the Touhou/Demetori naming format haha.\n<i>Monckat:</i>\nTried my best to create something as complex and intimidating as the track itself. The idea here was for the art to initially seem like random organic noise, with the Black King only popping into view on a closer look. Originally I was planning on using a lot more shading on this, some gradients and blur/glow effects too maybe. But I ultimately found it was more striking to restrict myself to only two colors. I like the idea that this is simultaneously my simplest track art in terms of color range and my most complex in terms of detail."

              "Commentary": "<i>Monckat:</i>\n[[The Lyrist]] is one of my favorite Homestuck tracks, with its main melody being in my humble opinion the most hauntingly beautiful refrain on the whole soundtrack. Which is why it's always driven me slightly mad that said melody only appears in the first 45 seconds and never returns. And while the rest of the track is wonderful in its own right, it's never stuck in my brain quite as much.\nSo the idea with this track was to attempt in my own flawed way to extend those first 45 seconds into a full track, and for the most part the way I chose to do that was to work in pieces of [[The Thirteenth Hour]] (along with adding in some original stuff). Hope you guys like it!\nThe title is in reference to a baker's dozen (13), which alludes to the use of [[The Thirteenth Hour]].\nThe teal and purple orbs are intended to be the orb things Alt Calliope uses to create the black hole in Act 7. My little headcanon for those orbs is that they're genesis frog frogspawn, basically embryonic universes. The idea being that since it took two universes to create the Green Sun, perhaps it takes three to destroy it."

              "Commentary": "<i>Gryotharian:</i>\nThere was a lot going on in the production of this, and none of it had to do with the final track. A long, long time ago, before any of my other submissions, I was going to do a Caliborn track, with the intent of being presented as a track that Caliborn himself produced. But at that time, there weren't many other submissions for this album yet, and a disturbingly high percentage of them were cherub related, so I dropped it. A year later, I was working on a remix of the afterword theme from Pesterquest, but it wasn't really clicking right. The heavy bass synths and bitcrushed drums weren't working for the style of the track. Around the same time, I finally got my hands on the incredibly elusive midi of [[track:carne-vale]], which has been my favorite homestuck song since the first time I heard it, and has yet to be dethroned. So I had the crazy notion, that the instruments I was using for my Pesterquest remix would work fantastically if I decided to go back to a Caliborn track, now that I could properly reference [[track:carne-vale]]. (I had been trying to figure out that bassline by ear for, oh lord, something like 3 years.) And, I ended up with what might be one of my favorite compositions of mine to date. Had it stuck in my head for months. Cleaned up the mixing over the next little while, and the rest is history. I had two names for it for a while, Teeth and Blood, and Space Crusader. Originally I was going to go with both, have one of those little ~ things in between, but I decided that Space Crusader, while it fit the vibe of the song, didn't really fit the vibe of Caliborn, so I dropped it."

In a weird way it was inspired by David Wise's ambient synth style, cause I'd been listening to a lot of the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack, especially Stickerbrush Symphony. For a game about a monkey fighting a crocodile over a pile of bananas, that game has a surprisingly amazing soundtrack. Once I had a chord progression down I felt like it should be about the cracks in the universe, with a similar vibe to [[Do You Remem8er Me|Do You Remem8er me]], and then I eventually ended up just referencing it at the end of the track. It didn't really end up very DKC or very [[Do You Remem8er Me|Do You Remem8er me]], but both those things are far outside of my usual style so I'm not all that surprised, and what it did turn out as is something I like a lot.\n<i>Cratmang:</i>\nWhen you think about it, Caliborn/Lord English is kind of a tragic figure. Multiple universes of emotions, and the only one he can understand is rage and hatred. I almost feel bad for him. Almost. Where was I going with this? Oh yeah.

This track began as an experiment with the layering of different-length loops on each other in a way that would never exactly repeat itself, which you can hear in pretty clearly the first section - it's something one encounters often in minimalist and ambient music, and I'd like to do more with the technique in the future. Hope you enjoy!\n<i>Monckat:</i>\nI like to think Caliborn worked really hard on this one, maybe it's hanging over a mantelpiece in Lord English's manor somewhere.

              "Commentary": "<i>Decon Theed, repeatedScales|[[artist:repeatedscales]]:</i>\nOh boy. I feel the best way to justify this mix of the song's entire existence is with the following; the original [[Gold Mage]] had a very barren and empty arrangement, designed to facilitate a vocal track that never actually got made, and though the lack of vocals probably helped it make [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|coloUrs & mayhem Vol. 1]] in the long run, a lot of people picked up on how empty the song felt. This mix was kind of my way of making up for that, but in the process I created the opposite problem of having TOO MUCH going on, especially in that first 'verse' section. Oh dear god, that first 'verse' section; I am baffled as to how I could possibly have thought that sounded good at the time. Technically speaking the cutting and looping on that guitar sample is very well done, but it doesn't work with the vibe of the beat, and it REALLY doesn't work with the bassline. The second 'verse' isn't much better, in that itself it's a nice chilled out rework of elements from the original, but it jars with the rest of the \"GET PUMPED\" vibe the tracks got going on. Also, man oh man, [[group:toby-fox|Toby Fox]] felt the solo from the end of the original song was boring; the solo on this song is utterly lifeless. It can barely be called a solo. Ok, ok, some positives; though the chorus is somewhat cluttered, I do like how punchy the chords sound using a more typical \"rave stab\" type sound (hell, in general the synth stabs on the cut are often the better elements), the stock sawtooth bass synth actually works quite nice with the bassline, and though it gets buried in a lot of the mix, the main drum machine beat over the 'verses' and the solo is actually quite punchy, and has a real late 90s game soundtrack vibe to it that I like. The original is definitely the better version of the song in the long run, though.\n<i>Makin:</i> (album management)\nThis amazing redux version of the [[album:coloUrs-and-mayhem-universe-a|Colours and Mayhem: Universe A]] track was hidden away in the musician's [bandcamp](https://103records.bandcamp.com/), known to few. It's time it saw the light of the mainstream and knocked your socks off."

              "Commentary": "<i>heir-of-puns:</i>\nSo [[track:synchronise]] is just...really really good and it makes me feel a lot of things. Yeah it's vocaloid and that's funny but god DAMN it gives me chills every time I listen to it. I've been working on this cover for maybe two and a half years now? Since the Before Times definitely. It has gone through a lot of tweaks but I'm pretty proud of it overall. HUGE thanks to Ucklin for final mastering and vocals, and to CJ for the harmonies! Pronunciation of the title is up for ~interpretation~ I guess. I wanted it to be a tribute to the original title, and also just seeing the [S] in front of the next arrow always gave me a rush of adrenaline since something amazing was probably about to go down. So you click on that arrow with anticipation and launch yourself into the experience and then freak out about it on the internet afterward. Here I go getting emotional about homestuck again, wild.\n<i>Ucklin:</i>\nI wanted to put a lot of emotion and expressivity into the vocals even if that made them a bit weird! Puns was really cool and waited a long time for me to finally record them while stuff was going on in my life. I'm glad I got to work with him!\n<i>Circlejourney:</i>\nYou can just hear the love and effort that went into the track, it brings the nostalgia rushing back so I tried to create an art piece that would do that justice."

I like the chill instruments and atmospheric chords from the original and wanted to do something similar.\n<i>Gryotharian:</i>\nThis ended up being some of the most work I've ever put into an art piece. I had the original idea for it long before it was finished, of Ult Dirk holding the broken lantern over a sleeping younger version of himself. At some point the skull got added, and the whole piece became very... I dunno how to describe it, like classical? Archetypical? Something like church stained glass, or a tarot card, and I gave Ult Dirk a halo type thing. Then a very unfinished version of it sat on my desktop for several months, just the rough outline with the colors blocked in. I slowly chipped away at it, adding details like each poster and book and the window, until finally I decided that I'd better finish this up, and did all the shading and lighting and everything in one incredibly long day. There's an alternate version without the highlight sketching, which I was unsure about, but Shwan said they liked this version better, so this is the version on the album."

I started it for more or less the same reason I started this blogthing - I mentioned that I felt that my music was gaining a sort of \"direction\" to it, and I guess this project is basically to see where it's going, and to develop my own style.\nThis project will involve remixing (at least) the four kid's Land Themes, along with adding my own touches to it. Whether I will do the troll Land Themes or not, we'll see. I don't want to make any particular commitment to that yet because that means another 12 songs, and I wasn't intending for this project to take too long. Plus I'll have to use mainly original stuff since with the exception of [[track:phaze-and-blood|Pulse and Haze]], none of the trolls lands have official themes.\nMaybe I'll just do it as an on-and-off thing after I'm done with the 4 lands.\n\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nCompleted around June 2011, the 7th Gate Project was a series of remixes of songs from webcomic and internet sensation Homestuck.\nThese remixes were done in an attempt to find my own \"sound,\" as it were, and they have contributed greatly to my growth as a musician. Recent developments in the comic have also led me to consider extending this project; it will be interesting to see how far my ability has developed since a year ago.\nEnjoy!\n\n<i>Niklink:</i> (wiki editor)\nTechnically speaking, this release doesn't have any actual cover artwork. However I would be remiss if I did not mention that on skaia.net, which has hosted a copy of this album for many many years, this release is represented by slightly modified artwork:\n<img src=\"media/misc/7th-gate-project.png\" width=\"300\">",

Soaring string melodies? Check. Piano solo with lots of reverb? Check. Chorus? (I know it's synthesized eh who cares) Check. Running notes, lots of them? Check. Dramatic piano octaves? Check. Mash them all together with a bunch of windy sounds and you get this.\nOne odd thing though is I'm using a Battery preset meant for dance songs. I, uh\ndon't actually like dance that much\nso it's a bit of an oddity that I actually use it a lot.\nI guess you would describe this song as a weird mishmash of dance-electronic-orchestral stuff.\nWhich is cool. I think I would quite like that, actually. I would definitely like to fiddle around more with electronic stuff though\nAlso, I find that this song is weak in the bass, which isn't really a weakness for this particular song but is more one of my weaknesses in general. So yes note to self: improve.\nThat's enough ramblin' from me.\n\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe Heir of Breath enters the Tower of the Tempest...\nAlthough many seem to prefer [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-frost-and-frogs|Land of Frost and Frogs]] more, this is my personal favorite from the set. For one, it strays furthest from the source material. For another, I experimented much more heavily with dynamic changes in this song, and I'm honestly quite happy with the outcome!"

In this case all I had was the opening and a rough idea of where I wanted the song to go. Dave is the perennial coolkid so I figured the Seventh Gate song for LOHAC would be far more casual than [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-wind-and-shade|LOWAS]].

Later there was [[Tribal Ebonpyre]], because I was using bongos already anyway.\nSo yes.\nIt's also a tribute to Castlevania music, to an extent.\nI also have a heck of a lot more percussion in this song than I otherwise would have; 1x drum kit, 1x sample set full of metallic-ish sounds, and bongos. I would have added record scratches too (it's Dave after all) if I had satisfactory ones, but I don't. Not now, anyway. If I ever revise this song I might find some and add them in.\nKey changes: there are 2. The second one, I think, actually works out better than the first despite the fact that I never intended for it to be there.\nAnnnnd finally we end with a simple drum riff and a fadeout. That's all folks! I'll probably work on [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-light-and-rain|LOLAR]] next.\n\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe Knight of Time enters the Forge of Flame...\nThis song was heavily inspired by the music of the Castlevania series. More specifically, I tried to emulate the style of one particular song - \"[Empty Tome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyXRV7wkeyoAn),\" from Order of Ecclesia. I think it's possibly one of my favorite songs from the series!"

Welp.\nIn any case this song demonstrates the things I like to do with slow songs - ramp up the reverb and delay, strings, background vocals. Orchestral percussion. Lots and lots of long notes. Music-box-ish ending (and even an interlude!).\nThis was supposed to be ambient-ish, and vaguely creepy. I actually quite like the opening! I tried to give it a sort of underwater alien feel because Rose's denizen did kill everything in the water after all. So yeah. On the other hand, I think it ended up sort of relaxing instead. Welp konec0 what are you doing.\nIt's not as if final dungeons can't have relaxing themes though.\nAlso: Now I'm wondering if I should have added rain sound effects.\nOh I remembered something else: I keep feeling like I have to get over my aversion to weird minor keys, so I decided to do this one in C# minor. Riiiight at the very end though I gave up; the music-box-ish part at the end was done in D minor and then I just transposed it down. I'm lazy, whatcha gonna do about it.\nAnyway that's about it for this one.\nNext up is [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-frost-and-frogs|LOFAF]]!... actually no. I think I'll let [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-frost-and-frogs|LOFAF]] sit for a while, because I don't really have any good ideas for it and I want it to be good. We'll see.\nMeow!\n\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe Seer of Light enters the Sea of Silence...\nSlow songs are definitely not my forte. As such, Land of Light and Rain was the hardest of the four songs for me. I tried using sounds such as the bowed waterphone to create an unsettling atmosphere, but I think the song still ended up sounding too relaxed and even a little sluggish.\nSlow songs are definitely something I have to improve on."

I lied.\nokay not really\nmore like I got an idea, but then I was going to do other stuff, but turns out it's one of those ideas that cripples your creative output unless you do it first, so yeah I was pretty much forced to do it\nthem's the breaks\nANYWAY.\n[[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] is one of my favourite Homestuck songs. Go listen to it because it is fantastic. I could probably leave it on loop all day and not get tired of it. It's also Jade's land theme so there's pretty much no way I wasn't going to put it in here.\nThe original idea for this song was always to use [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] as a \"backdrop\" and then link it to other songs, but to be perfectly frank I wasn't expecting to use [[Dissension (Original)|Dissension]]. I was intending to transition straight to [[Sunsetter]], but then I played a bunch of stuff and was like \"hey this sounds like a Homestuck song\" and it turned out to be [[Dissension (Original)|Dissension]] so I used it. My subconscious is a thief sometimes. Turned out for the better, really, it's one of those happy little coincidences that happen sometimes. =3\nAlso: [[Dissension (Original)|Dissension]] doesn't get remixed enough. Needs more luv~~\nLet's see, where was I.\n[[Sunsetter]] might seem like an odd choice really, but since its cousin [[track:sunslammer]] (by [[artist:seth-peelle|Beatfox]]) was [[flash:3001|featured in the comic itself]] it's become more or less linked to Jade, despite the fact that [[Sunsetter]] was originally supposed to be a Dave strife theme if I remember? And that is why I chose it! Which makes [[track:frost-vol6|Frost]] + 2 strife themes, which I think actually makes for a decent seventh-gate theme.\nStylistically I went for something between [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-wind-and-shade|LOWAS]] and [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-heat-and-clockwork|LOHAC]]. It's not as dynamic as the former in terms of... dynamics (-_-\") and tempo, but I went for stylistic shifts instead; the sudden orchestral [[Sunsetter]] was completely intentional though, as was the slower, more ambient ending. As a result this actually ended up more complex than [[track:through-the-seventh-gate-land-of-wind-and-shade|LOWAS]] did. It was quite fun to compose.\nAltogether it's a fun romp to end off the Seventh Gate Project, and I'm quite satisfied with it.\nNow what to do next hmmmmmm\n\n<i>(commentary redux)</i>\nThe Witch of Space enters the Glacier of Genesis...\nI really enjoyed pulling the sudden switch from what was essentially house-inspired electronica to orchestral. I've used several more times since, such as in [[Vodka Mutiny]] or [Jackpot (Birthday Bash Mix)](https://soundcloud.com/konec0/jackpot-birthday-bash-mix). I'm not personally fond of the idea of pigeonholing songs into genres, so making this song was a real treat for me; I like to think of it as kind of genre-fluid, and that's interesting to me.\""

It has been a long journey, one that has finally concluded.\n\nOver a year ago (July 2011, to be precise), I had a conversation that forever changed me. A question was posed:\n\n<i>What if Sburb came with stock BGM?</i>\n\nWhat if, indeed. I set out to provide an answer to that question.\n\nMy idea was to create an original soundtrack (or OST) for Sburb, a collection of generic, catch-all, session-nonspecific music to accompany every player throughout their journey.\n\nUpon presenting my pitch to the MSPA forums, I was met with a brilliant team of musicians and visual artists dedicated to making this a reality. Along the way we created some fantastic works of art, spawned an exciting narrative, and forged many strong friendships.\n\nIt is, again, a great pleasure for all of us to finally be able to bring this project to a satisfying conclusion, and to present it to those who have waited so long for its arrival.\n\n\\-[[artist:marcy-nabors|Marcy \"Shadolith\" Nabors]]<br>\nFounder and CEO of the imaginary Sburb OST Corporation\n\n•Special Thanks•<br>\nConception/Organization: [[artist:marcy-nabors]]<br>\nManagement/HR: [[artist:melodiousdiscord|M.

The melody is halfway between \"[[Sburban Jungle]]\" and \"[[track:another-jungle]]\" and was probably the least involved element. Everything else was an attempt to find a heavier sound than I had attempted with either of my tracks from the Homestuck soundtrack, and I guess this time around I made it happen. While the other two score a lot more merits for memorability, composition, and length, this one was definitely the most fun to produce - unlike its two predecessors it's more of an ass-shaker than a head-banger, so I like that.\n\n<i>Tavia Morra:</i>\nBetween the time I finished [[track:fly]] to when I was asked to make art for the Sburb OST, I had just picked up a book comprised entirely of panels and pictures of art deco design by Eugene Grasset. I was quite taken with the style and decided to add hints of it in the compositions of my Sburb OST art."

I tried to capture the initial apparent simplicity presented and curiosity elicited by the Sburb interface when one connects as a server player. The titular blissful ignorance is the topic at hand here, as the simple Animal Crossing inspired instrumentation calmly assures you that you have all the time in the world - but the world doesn't have much time left.\n\n<i>Esabelle Ryngin:</i>\nThe first time I heard this track when we were doing selections, I couldn't help but remember my days avidly playing Animal Crossing on the Gamecube and immediately picked it as one of my choices. Luckily, the music was cute enough that I got picked to do it! Thinking about how to make art for all these game OST tracks was harder than it sounded at first, because I wasn't entirely sure how I could convey clicking around without including a subject, which had at the time not been set as the composers of the music! Fortunately, though, we worked that out and I got to draw [[artist:marcy-nabors|Shadolith]] instead of some generic cutout!"

This piece was heavily inspired by [[Harlequin]] and [[Nannaquin]]. Who doesn't love glitchy sprites?\n\n<i>Dawn Davis:</i>\nI actually had a hard time coming up with what to do here so I relied on [[artist:veritas-unae|Scott]] and Marcy a lot for the concept. We used it as an excuse sort of to really get into a lot of the specific world and sprite stuff! In the end Marcy made a Squiddle Speaker Sprite which I LOVE because of how fucking terrifying it looks with that cyclops speaker eye. Veri has his self-writing story sprite, which is much more classy. And then we got Marcy and Veri's worlds in there, too. Up top you see the Land of Beats and Stirring Sonar, and below you have the Land of Music and Technology. It seems that I forgot how much fun I have with scenery and land designs until I joined the Sburb group."

It's loud, it's powerful, and it stops for no one, so you'd better be ready for it. This piece revolves around the anticipation of a timer constantly ticking towards turmoil, as well as the frantic nature of the whole puzzling process that must be completed while proximate meteors rain down in a destructive deluge. It is a chaotic cataclysm that builds up and up as the remaining minutes drain away - the countdown timer continues its steady death march until the very last second, when the hour is met and the final bell is struck.\n\nAlso, there are references to each of the Homestuck kids' medium entry songs inserted throughout, though not all are obvious.\n\n<i>invalidgriffin:</i>\nUnlike the other two pieces I made for this album, I didn't plan this one out at all! Luckily, the awesome folks in the chat space had ideas to spare about what [[artist:max-wright|Imbrog's]] totem lathe item should be. Thanks to them, [[artist:max-wright|Imbrog]] the SBURB Player will have to compose for his life before that meteor destroys everything he loves."

A Sprited Conversation is a nice contrast to the original chiptune song. Props to [[artist:max-wright|Imbrog]] and [[artist:marcy-nabors|Shadolith]] for providing piano and accordian, respectively.\n\n<i>Charles Neudorf:</i>\nFor \"A Spirited Conversation\" I once again contacted Veri and sent him a quick piano part I had written up as a suggestion for a \"Sprite exposition theme.\" Veri went above the call of duty and actually finished pretty much most of the song by himself! Then it was simply a matter of asking [[artist:max-wright|Imbrog]] and [[artist:marcy-nabors|Shadolith]] for the respective piano and accordian recordings. Thanks again guys!!!\n\n<i>Adoxographist:</i>\nWhile I was listening to A Spirited Conversation, it sounded kind of dark, but with a hopeful ending which reminded me of the moment where the players and their sprites separated. I guess this sort of idea that you have to leave a friend, but you know that thanks to that friend, you're strong enough to carry on. What was really tough was this idea of... How on earth do you show the relationship between a fellow and his sprite when his sprite is a book and has no human-esque features so to speak of?\n\nI wanted to draw something with a wistful atmosphere, like two friends saying goodbye, but making a book say goodbye is fairly challenging! I finally ended up with Veritas looking wistfully at the quill of his sprite. Maybe he's in the middle of saying goodbye, or they've already said goodbye, and all he has left as a reminder is that quill, or maybe they're just having tough times. Either way, I hope that the element of bitter-sweetness has gotten through?"

In keeping with the idea of procedurally evolving music, every section has the same tempo, key and chord progression, to perpetuate the scenario , threw in a small melodic reference to Bowman's [[track:waiting-for-adventure|loading screen theme]], because building is what Sburb is all about.\n\n<i>Alistair Diszrali:</i>\nMy name is Alistair Diszrali, and this is the piece I worked on for the build theme track."

Texturally, acoustic guitars, high strings, droning pads, and a bit of brass all make me think \"DESERT.\" The scale does most of the also desert themed, work establishing that, though. I wanted the song to be upbeat and include two parts. The first serves as a \"conversation theme\" to be played when the exiles are communicating with the players and \"exile action\" which, is unlikely to be heard by a player, but would accompany something more intense happening years in the future.\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i> (booklet editor)\n[YEARS IN THE FUTURE...<br>\nA ramshackle wanderer<br>\n...finds a giant book?]"

For this piece she had left the basic sketch, and I decided to take on the task of making it into a finished piece. The overall layout and the shape of the ogre with his rippling muscles was all Tawa, so my job was really one of trying to decide on a background, put the characters into some kind of context and to add finish and colour to the whole thing.

Within a day, [[artist:yan-rodriguez|Nucleose]] had hammered out the main theme on piano, which I then set about to arrange for full orchestra and electronics. I emerged nearly 6 months later, scarred from many bloody battles with the demons of procrastination, with a song called Waking the Beast (a title that I settled on months before Eidolon Orpheus' [[track:bargaining-with-the-beast]] was released). Though [[artist:yan-rodriguez|Nucleose]] would claim that he had almost no hand in the finished product, I incorporated (read: stole) many elements that are common in his music: uncommon meter, Phrygian mode, numerous gradual tempo changes, etc. SO THERE, YAN.\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i> (booklet editor)\n[It begs the question...<br>\nHow zen is a denizen<br>\nwhen it's in a den?]"

The Dreamer in the image does exactly that while curious Prospitians look on. I'm not sure what he's seeing in those clouds, but I bet it's exciting. I bet he'll remember it when the time is right."

I had an idea of what I wanted to do very early on. What's actually interesting about this image isn't the image itself, but the fact that I've worked on a lot of stuff with Rayner before, and this is actually my third time doing album art for his work because we're both involved in the 'Vacant Sky' RPG series. Because we never really talk directly on that project and because he goes by 'Tarranon' and I by 'Darth Mongoose' there rather than 'Rayner' and 'felicitousArtisan' we didn't realise we already knew each other! I just happened to pick the piece because I liked it. Kind of a funny coincidence."

In Homestuck, Jack's theme \"[[Black]]\" is pretty darn crazy with all the pitch bending and running notes, but to be honest? I don't think it fits with Jack as a character. Don't get me wrong - it's perfectly justified within the context of Homestuck because Jack goes batshit insane after getting the bunny. But if you look at him within the context of a regular session, he's, well - a washed-up Archagent stuck in a dead-end job who hates his superior. And that's not very exciting. So I made something that sounds more like a funeral march. It's your funeral, because after the song's over, he <i>shoas u his stabbz</i>.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nSome explanation is required for this piece. Kon made the sprite that made Jack hate him at least 10 times more. A Party Cat sprite. Sadly for Jack, these are not corpse parties, these are the good old fashioned cake, confetti, and music parties. So imagine you are Jack. You went to bed feeling disgruntled as always but that's nothing new. You are then suddenly wakened by DD, HB, and CD playing a rousing and lively song outside your door. How do you feel?"

He feels groggy, and his entire body feels heavy, as if he's been sleeping for ages, so long it's forgotten how to move. There's something in the back of his head, something that sounds like white noise, or static, or strange whispers. He dismisses them for the moment; it's probably the headache talking, he thinks. The second thing he notices, as he forces himself to sit up, is how everything is purple. The walls of his room are lined with violet and indigo, and even his sheets and his pajamas (he didn't remember putting these on before going to sleep; heck, he didn't even remember having them) are similar shades. This must be a dream, he thinks, and yet he is unable to shake the feeling that this is terribly, frighteningly real. The third thing he notices is how dark and quiet it is. Faint light streams in through the window, from a blue planet far away. It's thin and wispy, as if shining from behind a veil. The eerie silence makes his skin crawl. He strides over to the window, and looks up, towards the endless void. There is nothing there, and yet it beckons him, and he is nearly compelled to leap into the abyss. Tearing his gaze away from the vast nothingness, he peers downwards instead - and there it is, stretching out before him in all its glory: Derse, the planet in shadow.</i>\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i> (booklet editor)\n[Planet in Shadow?<br>\nWith all that purple, more like<br>\nPlanet of the Grapes]"

We see a range of personalities, from the cold, calculating Droog to the bumbling Deuce, the goofy Vagabond and the highstrung Renegade. Also, with the possible exception of Jack, they don't really seem that evil or malicious to me. If you'll forgive my use of the term, they seem like Punch Clock Villains, just out to do their job, like the soldiers of any army. That job unfortunately includes the extermination of Prospit. That doesn't necessarily mean they're the bad guys here per se! From a musical standpoint, the Dersites have also been very much linked with jazz for me, especially since the Midnight Crew album. It just seems to fit; they're dark, but not really evil. I didn't entirely subscribe to the Midnight Crew's \"dark jazz,\" though - they're more diverse than that. So I went with a jazzy piece with different elements that hopefully capture the different personalities of the Dersites we've seen so far - lighthearted piano for the Drolls and smooth jazz for the Dignitaries.\n\n<i>Selan Pike:</i>\nI was so excited to get this one, oh man oh man, I love the Dersite characters so much and also the song is great and oh gosh. So I was all \"yeah I think I'll do a nice picture of DD and CD\" and I talked to Cat Boss and he mentioned WV and I was like, OH MAN. All my babbies. So yeah then I tried to do something with WV and DD with the flag and spear in an X pattern, and it looked dumb, so I drew this. And spent about ten million hours on overlays getting the colors juuuuuust so. And it's hardly even noticeable, bluh."

The second half is a very Metroid Prime inspired exploration piece, to be heard while exploring ruins on your personal world. The result is a very mysterious song indeed.\n\n<i>melodiousDiscord:</i>\nI interpreted the riddle as [[artist:marcy-nabors|Shadolith]] entering a temple in his land and then when she finally reaches the core she sees the heart of the land along with ancient carvings. Shadolith is confronted with a strange tablet on the wall (representing the prophecy about her becoming a god) and a series of holes in the wall. Said holes actually make up part of the melody to the song \"Gods of the New World\". Would playing those measures actually be relevant to creating the new world? They might be, or they might not."

That idea ended up not really coming to fruition due to various reasons, so I just settled on writing a piece solely focused on the veil, and I'm still very proud of how it turned out! I really think that as I worked on it, I gained a much richer understanding of how compositions are made, and for better or worse, it has deeply impacted how I look at music.\n\n<i>Esabelle Ryngin:</i>\n[[artist:charles-neudorf|Crazy-8]] has been a good friend of mine for about a year now, and when I heard that he was going to be submitting to this album, I immediately set my heart on doing the cover art for it.

When making this song, I drew from sources of inspiration including Super Mario Galaxy and the phazon-related songs from the Metroid Prime trilogy. I tried to capture just how weird it would be to see an unfathomably massive star out in the middle of complete blackness, suspended in the void, stationary yet serving some great cosmic purpose.\n\n<i>Charles Neudorf:</i>\nThis song would be entirely nothing without Absynth 5.\n\n<i>Mixt:</i>\n<i>There's something about facing off against something so big - especially something with the mass of two universes - out in the middle of nowhere and nothing that is incredibly humbling, even if you are a god.</i>\n\nMy first thought when thinking of the Green Sun is a surface of rolling, boiling fire, hotter and brighter than anything you've ever seen. Solar flares that reach distances you can't even imagine. I also had a brief flash to another celestial body with a turbulent, stormy atmosphere: Jupiter, whose Giant Red Spot I ended up making an allusion to."

I was the original artist attached to it, but had to drop out of the SburbOST project to focus on everything else that was going on. Eventually, [[artist:melodiousdiscord|Cadrien (mD)]] attempted something for it, but struggled due to his lack of compositional experience. Nonetheless, the pentatonic idea he went with (similarly to the canon [[Skies of Skaia]]) was the base that Marcy and I ultimately used in our reinterpretation... after I managed to get myself involved with the project again.\n\nOur opinion is that this piece is a more accurate representation of Skaia compared to [[Skies of Skaia]]. The focus is on the bittersweet concept that Skaia is both a creator and destroyer of life.\n\n<i>Toe:</i>\nYou gotta admit, Skaia is beautiful.<br>\nI tried to portray its surrounding as enchantingly unique as I possibly could by using awkward vibrant colors.

The crescendo and accelerando throughout is meant to embody the returning of vitality and infusion of power.

I mean, it's such an epic concept in general and more than just getting groovy hooded pyjamas. I decided to do something that'd reflect the 'resurrection' aspect of ascending; I love the animations of John and Jade's with the big sparkly skies and stuff.

Also, it's hard to imagine a little child running around and not being overzealous at the thought of catching Frogs to use in experiments. There's also a reference in there I was asked to put in - it might be obvious. I personally haven't played the game referenced but it's a funny little one nonetheless that I was happy to put in. It's very Irish sounding, too, which could have come from playing a lot of marches in an orchestra while I was writing this piece.\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i>\nMy first attempt at this art ended up being a little too dark and dreary for the music, so I whipped up this one instead. Veritas and Traikan (out Space player in the background) catching frogs. I kind of suck at backgrounds and foreshortening, but hopefully I added enough shinies to cover that up."

So I picked up his theme and remixed it, while mixing some of my own melodies in. In my mind Sburb is an action RPG, so I wanted something fast and action-y. I didn't actually necessarily know where I was going to go with it so it ended up this fast-paced, nearly dance-esque thing? With multiple segments, heh. And then Marcy stepped in with Shreddage and tossed some badass guitar at me, and I added that in too. So now you have a song which starts off with a sort of let's fite kind of atmosphere, and later it gets pretty badass, so I'd say it turned out pretty well on the whole! Also, there's a quick reference to \"[[track:waking-the-beast|Waking the Beast]]\" in the ending. I love that song.\n\n<i>Dawn Davis:</i>\nThere's a lot to say about this picture that makes the whole thing really hilarious, and not in a structural way. The narratives that are taking place make no sense at all, and I think it's really funny. I had conceptualized the [[track:the-will-to-fight-original-mix|original Denizen Strife theme]] to take place with Cetus as the subject, but when the game came together with the musicians as players, this no longer made any sense. We don't have any Light players. As a matter of fact, we don't have any Breath players, either. [[artist:catboss|konec0]] is the Boss of Cats and [[artist:kevin-grant|Underwater Basketweaver]] is the King of Queens. I really had no canon denizens for those titles, so I drew Typheus for fun. When listening to the song I could imagine the backgrounds changing according to the different movements, but I couldn't make track art of that so I just idly drew up [[artist:catboss|konec0's]] Land of Flight and Thunder. Still, the mish-mash of elements and locations and denizen doesn't actually make any sense. [[artist:catboss|konec0]] and I figured what this means is that he and [[artist:kevin-grant|UWBW's]] have been running around killing other people's denizens.\n\nThe <i>jerks</i>."

I wanted to create a piece which constantly builds tension as a player is supposed to make up their mind about what their choice is going to be. I didnt want to create a clear resolution because the choice is a choice, it is up to the player what happens. This piece is just impossibly-tough-decision-making-music. I think it fits.\n\n<i>Dawn Davis:</i>\nI want to say \"The Choice is one of my favourite songs on the Sburb OST\" but that would be a lie just because I love absolutely everything on the Sburb OST. Either way I was really excited when I got to do the art for this song. It's so slow, smooth, beautiful and dramatic, and I wanted a piece that could convey that. I wanted it to be dark, hopefully have Echidna in a silhouette somehow with glowing eyes.\n\nI experimented with a side-view of her before we got the outline of what you see here. Then we tried to go with a bright background, but it wasn't working out, which I'm still pretty sorry for. The bright BG could have worked in a pair of scales, which I was excited to use because of all of the music puns we could make. But when I got this BG I knew we had a winner.\n\nThe entire time I was drawing it I would occasionally say to myself, in hushed tones, quietly.... <i>pchoooooooo</i>.

The harp, the flute, and the light bongo-esque percussion give the track a hint of an Aztec or Incan, just barely South/Central American flavor. Originally I considered a slight electronic twist, but decided to opt for something more... professional? Orchestral seemed to be the texture de jour in this OST, and I don't write that way much, so it was an opportunity to push myself production wise. Compositionally, I knew I wanted to use a minor scale for the ominous and sublime nature of a volcano, and I settled on F# minor mostly because of the way I-V-VII-I sounds.\n\n<i>Selan Pike:</i>\nI think we can all agree that volcanos are awesome. I've never been great at scenery, but it's something I've been practicing and actually when I decided to audition for this project I was hoping for some scenery to draw! I went into this one thinking \"Okay, I think I'll draw the volcano and a Space player looking at it\", and I asked Traikan for direction and he asked for his self-insert character, and also his land, which helped me flesh out my idea a lot. Also his land was super, super fun to draw. He gave me a lot of references for his character and I kind of feel bad that I didn't put more detail on him, but I didn't want to draw attention away from the Forge..."

The piece shows shifts between the two; the trumpet fanfare into the fast section and the slow down to the start section again allow for transition between untouched rooms and rooms with action. Thanks to [[artist:yan-rodriguez|Nucleose]] for all his assistance on this song too - it really helped make it what it is.\n\n<i>Mixt:</i>\nOne of my favourite things in RPGs is exploring every knook and cranny of the environment, although sometimes it's also a bit nerve wracking because you might not know what's around the corner. How long can you continue unhindered? What will you find?\n\nWill you like what you find in the middle of this war?"

It's heavily inspired by Nobuo Uematsu's \"Dancing Mad\", from FFVI; in fact, I considered making a very long unloopable thing, but along the way it became apparent that it would be pretty unfeasible. So now it has a intro, two loopable middle sections, and the ending. They are as follows:\n\nHerald of the End - An ominous chorus heralds the coming strife between the heroes and the Black King, as the players stride up to face the final boss.\n\nMarch of the Black King - The Black King laughs at the puny players, and attacks. He plays around with his prey attacking with his scepter and abilities gained by the various prototypings. However, the players give him far more than he bargained for.\n\nHeroes: Rise Up - With an earth-shattering roar, we enter the final phase of the battle. The Black King is clearly getting desperate now, pummeling the heroes with everything he has, and bringing the full force of the Reckoning to bear. The heroes respond in kind; they can't afford to lose...\n\nHerald of the End (Reprise) - ...and finally, their efforts are rewarded. The Black King stumbles, and with a final cry, he crashes to the ground, vanquished once and for all.\n\nI took a lot of elements from previous, unreleased songs, but that would take too long to go through. Enjoy!\n\n<i>shymuffin:</i>\nI'm pretty pleased that I managed to get in every single first prototype that was listed to me.<br>\nIncluding that Obama picture."

It takes a couple of motifs from [[track:checkerboard-checkmate|Battlefield]] and [[track:check-the-chequered-castle|Castle]] themes but ultimately it came into its own. The trumpets take a harmony from the start of Battlefield, while the main repeated motif of [[track:check-the-chequered-castle|Castle]] is interspersed on different instruments throughout. The second violin brings in [[track:checkerboard-checkmate|Battlefield's theme]] briefly before the end.\n\nOn the art, I asked Pseudonym if she'd be willing to draw some album art for me. I suggested the reflection of a battleship in Veritas' glasses, the Reckoning causing many ships to be struck by meteors and catch a-blaze. The sketch she drew was fantastic, and I'd like to extend many thanks to [[artist:brad-griffin|Avinoch]] for finishing the art up for us!\n\n<i>Brad Griffin:</i>\nI can't really speak to the concept behind this art piece.

It's supposed to sound menacing while at the same time spurring you into action. A real fight-or-die situation would have music like this. Overall, I just tried to have fun with this piece, drawing inspiration from songs like [[Chaotic Strength]] and [[Tomahawk Head]]. While I don't think the song is as good as it could be, other obligations (and further computer failures) caused me leave it a bit unpolished.\n\n<i>Dawn Davis:</i>\nAs soon as I laid my ears on The Will To Fight I knew I wanted to be related with this song somehow. It's just so poppy and catchy and wonderful. I sent Marcy a looong e-mail detailing why she should let me do the art for the track. I just love this song so much, I wanted desperately to have the honor of doing the art. I really wanted to convey a sense of scale with the Denizen because there's some pretty epic battle vibes in this song, and a great build-up that I thought I could reflect well with size. I also wanted some classic video game effects to get the old school boss battle feel, but nothing I did quite looked right, so I just have that glow in place instead. I'm so excited that this piece made it onto the album. It's been on pretty much every playlist I've made for myself since I heard it the first time."

      "Commentary": "<i>Cool and New Music Team:</i>\ni'ts album fro cool and new web comic\nits the 1th one\n\n<i>Niklink:</i>\nThere's so much to be said about the absurd trajectory of the Cool and New Music Team, but I'll try to keep it short.\n\nAfter the release of the incredible [[album:homestuck-vol-10]], which was a sort of epitaph to the official music team, [a Q&A stream was held with the musicians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJWqqikd6S0). There was a bittersweet tinge to it, not just because of Homestuck's recent ending, but because they reflected on their artistic trajectories and how they had been musical amateurs that had been able to refine and hone their skill through the comic's run. To me at least they had always felt like inimitable performers, even if I'd always aspired to be as good as them or as the high-quality fan music that was being made at the time. But their encouraging talk about how they had progressed as artists over the years led to an idea formed right there, in the livestream chat. Why not make our <i>own</i> music team?\n\nA music team on our own terms, expressly as a practice vehicle, to create and release music without a care in the world as to whether it was good or bad or terrible? No shame, no hesitation, just for the hell of making Homestuck fanmusic, and maybe improving along the way. Cool and New Web Comic's popular but low-quality presentation was a natural fit. And the response was massive. It turned out many people felt the same way, or simply wanted to see what all the noise was about.\n\nOnly two weeks later, the newly-created Cool and New Music Team released a 50-track album. This is that album.\n\n<i>Ngame:</i>\n([Community listening stream w/ chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6e2NvlY9oc))",

I don't really blame them, drawing is hard enough without knowing that it's probably going to be playing second fiddle to the music anyways.

It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which is my free credit score. This number is between my buttocks. This number, I am thinking, is between four hundred and fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number it is, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. But the number is between my buttocks! Do you know what number it is? It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and the number is between my buttocks. The number is seven hundred and twenty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between my buttocks. It happens to be between four fifty and eight fifty, and it could save me a lot of money the higher it is. Fortunately that number is seven hundred and twenty, which is a number between four fifty and eight fifty. This number between four fifty and eight fifty happens to be between my buttocks. The higher the number is between my buttocks, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money. This number happens to be between my buttocks, which means I will save a lot of money. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? The number I'm thinking of is seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be between my buttocks. It's between four fifty and eight fifty.

It's my free credit score, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and between my buttocks. The higher this number that is seven hundred and twenty is, that is between four fifty and eight fifty is, the better my chances at saving a lot of money. Between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it for me? I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty, and that it's between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and grab it? It's a number between seven hundred and twenty and seven hundred and twenty, and it happens to be also between four fifty and eight fifty, and between my buttocks. Won't you reach in and get it? I'm thinking that you can reach in and get it, because it is between my buttocks. Won't you reach and and get this free credit report, that is between my buttocks. The number is between four fifty and eight fifty, and it happens to be seven hundred and twenty. The higher this number is that is seven hundred and twenty, the better chance I have at saving a lot of money between my buttocks. Won't you reach in between my buttocks and grab this number? That is greater than four fifty, and less than eight fifty. This number is seven twenty, and you can grab it because it's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number that could save you a lot of money. It's between my buttocks. It happens to be seven hundred and twenty, and it is between the numbers four fifty and eight fifty. It could save you a lot of money. A lot of money between my buttocks! But I'm thinking that this number is between four fifty and eight fifty. The higher this number is, although the highest can be eight hundred and fifty, the better chance you have of saving a lot of money. This number is between my buttocks. You can reach in between my buttocks and get a number. Hopefully this number is greater than four fifty and less than eight fifty. Otherwise it might not be your credit score! My credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, which as you all have noticed, is between four fifty and eight fifty. But do you know what number I'm thinking of? I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Fortunately, seven hundred and twenty is this number, because it is between four hundred and fifty and eight hundred and fifty. But I'm thinking of a number between four fifty and eight fifty. Do you know what it is? It happens to be between my buttocks, and it could save you a lot of money. The higher this number between my buttocks is, the more money it could save you! I'm thinking of a number though, that is between my buttocks. It is still seven hundred and twenty. Won't you reach in and grab seven hundred and twenty for me? Don't grab four fifty or eight fifty, as these are the two extremes. These are not my free credit score. My free credit score happens to be seven hundred and twenty, but I'm thinking that you can reach in and grab it because it is between my buttocks. The number between my buttocks happens to be, well, I'm thinking that it's seven hundred and twenty. But I could be wrong. Because your number could be anywhere between four fifty and eight fifty.

When it was initially released, there was a lot of speculation, particularly on the MSPA Forums, around the idea of combining or layering the different tracks on the album to find cool mashups, particularly the matching song pairs for each Land. It was even implied that this was a specific musical choice by [[artist:clark-powell]], to make 'hidden' music (she immediately denied this, but it had no effect). Ultimately it culminated in the creation of 'Medium - Mega Mix', which was for all intents and purposes all eight tracks in the album sandwiched on top of one another into an ungodly sound wall, which was nevertheless positively received by fans. This worthless shitpost of a song is based on that phenomenon, as well as being a sort of 'tribute' to [[album:homestuck-vol-10]] which had after all been the insipration to establish CaNMT in the first place.\n\nAlso in a way, getting the obvious unfunny ear torture shitposts out of the way early on meant subsequent CaNMT musicians would be forced to innovate. So, in a sense, you're welcome?"

Practically nothing.\n\nDo you people realize how little music Jade has to begin with? She really only has [[Gardener]] and [[Dissension (Original)|Dissension]], the two songs you just heard. To take those, remix them into a workable song, add my own stuff, and then deliberately make it sound shitty to fit in with the rest of the Cool and New Web Comic... That, I, that's not really an excuse, other musicians have done far more with far less... the rest of this album is proof enough of that.\n\nI guess what it comes down to, is that... I'm not just not as good of a musician, or, really, artist of any way. I don't have talent. I think Hussie said something like \"it actually takes a large amount of skill to get Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff to the perfect amount of shittiness\"... and I don't have the drive or talent or skill to do that, or really anything.\n\nI mean... I did take piano composition classes through middle school but... I haven't done anything since then so... it's almost as if I'd done nothing. And here I am in the middle of a team of people who are actually... putting effort into making good — if difficult to listen to — music, and... I'm left wondering exactly what I can bring to the table.\n\n...Nothing, really. I've thought long and hard about it, and... that's my answer. Nothing. I guess there's only one thing left to do.\n\n\"To: Cool and New Web Comic Music Team. Subject: Resignation. Body: I regret to inform you that I will no longer be creating music with all of you. Good luck in the future, I'm out.\" Guess I'm really doing this, huh?\n\nSend.)"

While they still appear as their original releases in the albums on this artist page, they were promptly replaced with tracks by other music team members, and eventually [[album:homestuck-vol-1-4]] was released, including several replacement tracks. The entire fiasco around Bolin has long been infamous within the music fandom.\nIt also came to public light later that Bolin had acted transphobic towards another music team member.",

Said track was available as a MIDI file, which makes it quite easy to repurpose and alter existing music.\n\nIn response, they claimed that it had been an honest mistake, forgetting that this old track was derivative of someone's else work when asked to submit all the music they could for Volume 5 (this is why the album is so huge). Nevertheless they readily agreed to have all their music removed from the album and to leave the music team."
